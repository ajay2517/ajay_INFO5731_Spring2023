"Had them for 2 years: dropped the case everyday with headphones inside and will continue to do so. It’s very fun throwing the case around it has a good weight to it and feels good in the hands.When the case falls the AirPods eject out and the AirPods are so light that they basically won’t get any fall damage. Good quality audio punchy bass. And amazing microphone very clear with calls.My only gripe was in the first week of use after purchase , I use both iPhone and android and for some reason on the android they were a little annoying with connecting fast but after a week it connected to the android as quickly as it did with the iPhone. You can still pause and play too but you won’t be able to see battery status. No big deal.Battery life and charge up is good. Expect 6 to 8 hours of playtime and charges up in like 5 minutes for 20~30 min play time. I leave these in my car when it’s hot as hell and the battery is still fine surprisingly. I don’t remember if these come with a cable or not but the apple charger cables  are complete trash and will stop working but yea that’s apple for you.  The headphones look  ugly at first  because it seems too long but you get used to to the look after a week or twoIf you lose the AirPods tho you better hope you have iPhone, not sure if android has an app to locate them but honestly these aren’t easy to lose as they didn’t fall out of my ears and you can exercise with them as well and sweat with them. Just don’t forget putting them back in your case when you're doneCase is prone to getting dirty by design but no biggieI’m an apple hater and I I approve these headphones.Def buying these again if I need to."

"I've had my AirPods for over a year now, and I have to say, I'm still impressed with their quality and performance. I've used them for everything from phone calls and video chats to working out and listening to music, and they've never let me down.Pros:Effortless setup: Connecting the AirPods to my iPhone was a breeze. All I had to do was open the case near my phone and it automatically prompted me to connect.Great sound quality: The sound is crisp and clear, and I never have any trouble hearing my calls or music.Good battery life: I can wear them all day without needing to charge them.Good charging case: The case is small and easy to carry around, and it charges the AirPods quickly.Cons:Price: At this price the AirPods are not cheap, but I think they're worth the investment for their quality and convenience. I also have a set of cheap wireless headphones that work great, so only spend the money if you have it.I also bought a cute pink case for my AirPods and it's perfect. It keeps my AirPods safe and secure, and it makes it easy to spot them in my bag.Overall, I'm very happy with my AirPods and I would definitely recommend them to anyone looking for a high-quality, convenient pair of wireless earbuds."

"Taking the Apple AirPods at face value, they're a solid headset for the money! If you already have the original, first generation AirPods and just want to upgrade, not a bad option either. The 2nd generation AirPods feature an improved software chip & runs off of BlueTooth 5.0 vs 4.1 (Gen 1). The software chip allows a faster, stronger, and more stable connection with your device(s). This particular item for $139.00 does NOT feature the wireless charging case. This one must be plugged in via USB (cable provided in the box) to an outlet or USB port. The wireless charging case model is $169. Now if you're looking to upgrade to the wireless charging case later on, you can. Apple does sell it separately. If you want the wireless charging option right out of the box, I recommend sending the $169 vs the $139 product here.Sound quality: Straight out of the box, sound is pretty solid. No crackles, static, pops, or any abnormal noises created by the more economic-friendly headsets. You have a lot more adjustability & tuning capabilities if paired on an iOS/Apple device vs using for example paired with an Android OS device. So, ultimately Apple users may or may not get a better sound quality experience.Noise cancellation: AirPods do fit fairly well in the ear without having to be jammed inside your ear canal. Generally they create a snug fit using Apple's ""universal"" earphone design, it is one size fits most not one size fits all. Some users have upgraded or opted to spend the additional funds on a set of AirPods Pro due to the rubber tips for a better/snug fit. I believe only the AirPods Pro currently has an active noise cancellation utilizing two microphones but I would double-check Apple for accurate information. Also, for Android users. The Galaxy buds by Samsung feature active noise cancellation & wireless charging case on every model so you might want to look into that product before making a final purchase.Battery life: For optimal battery life, I highly recommend charging both AirPods inside the case. The case itself is a battery pack with a life. So if one or both AirPods are low on battery, you can toss them in the case and charge them up. Apple I believe rates 5 minutes of charging time is equivalent to 1 hour of talk/listening time and 15 minutes of charging time is equivalent to 2 hours of talk/listening. I'm sure this is accurate when they're brand new but I'm sure like anything, normal ware & tare might diminish that over time.Warranty: Apple provides a 1-year standard manufacturer's warranty on this product. This ONLY covers defects/defaults from the manufacturer. This will NOT cover physical and/or liquid damages to AirPods, case, or charging cable included.AppleCare: It's $29.00 and 2 years and well worth the extra money. You're already spending this kind of money on a headset, may as well have protection. We get it, accidents happen! But protect yourself and get your AirPods repaired/replaced at no additional cost to YOU! There is no additional fees or deductibles involved.AppleCare tips:You don't have to install AppleCare right away. You have 60 days from the original purchase date to contact Apple by providing your AirPods serial number (on outside of the box) and Apple will tell you if you're still eligible.You can renew AppleCare for another 2 years for the same fee of $29.00 provided you want to keep the same product. If you decide to upgrade to the AirPods Pro or whatever the latest model is, you would have to purchase AppleCare for that specific product.You can go into an Apple store location and get live repair/replacement on your AirPods.Using AirPods with Android:Apple has allowed Android and other non-iOS devices to use AirPods since the AirPods pair/connect via BlueTooth.If you're using AirPods on an Android platform such as Samsung or LG for example there's 2 ways to pair the headset to your device. You either turn on BlueTooth on your device, pop both AirPods inside your ear, find ""AirPods"" under available connections, and connect. Or you might have to pair manually using the button on the AirPods case to make available, pair, and connect.FAIR WARNING:You will NOT have access to all features that the AirPods have to offer on an Apple/iOS device. You will be limited on functions you can perform.I was able to find an app on Google play store for $1.99 called ""AirPopUp"". It is a paid application that unlock access to certain/more features of the AirPods similar to what an Apple/iOS device would be granted. Be aware that you will NOT have access nor the ability to have every single feature since you're not on Apple's network. There may be other apps (most likely paid applications) you'd have to find that may unlock more features such as: AirPods battery life percentage, case battery life percentage, programming LEFT & RIGHT AirPods for certain function(s), skipping/pausing/resetting songs, answer/decline/hang up phone calls, find my AirPods, and more.For Samsung users specifically, you might want to look into the Galaxy Buds. They're a little cheaper than AirPods, I believe Amazon has them for $109.99 + $22 3-Year insurance through Assurion that does cover physical/liquid/accidental damage just like AirPods.Galaxy Buds features:Made by SamsungAudio powered by AKGRubber ear bud tipsPair with Samsung device to get the mostWireless charging caseActive noise cancellationComes in multiple colors (black/white/silver/yellow/red & black combo with Star Wars edition Galaxy Note 10+)Includes changing cord and replacement rubber earbud tips.I know if you pair the Galaxy Buds with a Samsung device it will automatically download an application titled ""Galaxy Wearable"". This allows users to check battery life status of the case and each bud, prompts you for software updates, ability to program LEFT & RIGHT earbuds to do certain function(s), answer/decline/hang up phone calls, pause/skip/reset songs.Apple may charge a lot of money for their products on accessories but they never fall short of being a revolutionary, well-designed, reliable product that works as advertised."

"I’ll list a few things I think are Good, and What’s Not So Great.The Good: Ummm…Owning an iPhone and a Apple Watch I already have a few lightning cables lying around.Not So Great: The cost. They are not inexpensive. I think I got the cheapest pair and that comes with a wired charging case and really not that impressive of features or sound quality. I am not that thrilled with the fact that the right one went “out” on me. I had to google a remedy for that issue. I believe it involved cleaning them and re-pairing them with my devices. It just wasn’t what I expected from Apple. I’m not thrilled with the fit and comfort. I, honestly, have to CoNsTaNtLy mess with the fit so I can EVeN HeAr TheM. I find that to be pretty unacceptable. If they are pushed in to far, I can’t hear them at all. I need to position them just right (up, down, depth, and turned in my ear at the correct angle) so I can hear them. If I’m talking, chewing, or otherwise moving…forget about it, they’re as useless as my nipples. It’s stupid to have to keep messing with them so I can hear them. “Ain’t Nobody Got Time For That!” I’m kinda wishing I would have bought the Amazon Echo earbuds. Alexa is vastly superior to Siri and I’m hoping that the use ability and fit will be better."

I don’t know what took me so long to get a pair of AirPods. It’s so nice to not worry about chords getting tangled up and broken. My only complaint is that they do get a bit uncomfortable after a few hours of wearing them (I do have pretty small ears though). The silicone tips on the pros probably would be much more comfortable but I didn’t feel like spending the extra money.

And amazing microphone very clear with calls.My only gripe was in the first week of use after purchase , I use both iPhone and android and for some reason on the android they were a little annoying with connecting fast but after a week it connected to the android as quickly as it did with the iPhone. You can still pause and play too but you won’t be able to see battery status. No big deal.Battery life and charge up is good. Expect 6 to 8 hours of playtime and charges up in like 5 minutes for 20~30 min play time. I leave these in my car when it’s hot as hell and the battery is still fine surprisingly. I don’t remember if these come with a cable or not but the apple charger cables  are complete trash and will stop working but yea that’s apple for you.  The headphones look  ugly at first  because it seems too long but you get used to to the look after a week or twoIf you lose the AirPods tho you better hope you have iPhone, not sure if android has an app to locate them but honestly these aren’t easy to lose as they didn’t fall out of my ears and you can exercise with them as well and sweat with them. Just don’t forget putting them back in your case when you're doneCase is prone to getting dirty by design but no biggieI’m an apple hater and I I approve these headphones.Def buying these again if I need to."
"I've had my AirPods for over a year now, and I have to say, I'm still impressed with their quality and performance. I've used them for everything from phone calls and video chats to working out and listening to music, and they've never let me down.Pros:Effortless setup: Connecting the AirPods to my iPhone was a breeze. All I had to do was open the case near my phone and it automatically prompted me to connect.Great sound quality: The sound is crisp and clear, and I never have any trouble hearing my calls or music.Good battery life: I can wear them all day without needing to charge them.Good charging case: The case is small and easy to carry around, and it charges the AirPods quickly.Cons:Price: At this price the AirPods are not cheap, but I think they're worth the investment for their quality and convenience. I also have a set of cheap wireless headphones that work great, so only spend the money if you have it.I also bought a cute pink case for my AirPods and it's perfect. It keeps my AirPods safe and secure, and it makes it easy to spot them in my bag.Overall, I'm very happy with my AirPods and I would definitely recommend them to anyone looking for a high-quality, convenient pair of wireless earbuds."
"Taking the Apple AirPods at face value, they're a solid headset for the money! If you already have the original, first generation AirPods and just want to upgrade, not a bad option either. The 2nd generation AirPods feature an improved software chip & runs off of BlueTooth 5.0 vs 4.1 (Gen 1). The software chip allows a faster, stronger, and more stable connection with your device(s). This particular item for $139.00 does NOT feature the wireless charging case. This one must be plugged in via USB (cable provided in the box) to an outlet or USB port. The wireless charging case model is $169. Now if you're looking to upgrade to the wireless charging case later on, you can. Apple does sell it separately. If you want the wireless charging option right out of the box, I recommend sending the $169 vs the $139 product here.Sound quality: Straight out of the box, sound is pretty solid. No crackles, static, pops, or any abnormal noises created by the more economic-friendly headsets. You have a lot more adjustability & tuning capabilities if paired on an iOS/Apple device vs using for example paired with an Android OS device. So, ultimately Apple users may or may not get a better sound quality experience.Noise cancellation: AirPods do fit fairly well in the ear without having to be jammed inside your ear canal. Generally they create a snug fit using Apple's ""universal"" earphone design, it is one size fits most not one size fits all. Some users have upgraded or opted to spend the additional funds on a set of AirPods Pro due to the rubber tips for a better/snug fit. I believe only the AirPods Pro currently has an active noise cancellation utilizing two microphones but I would double-check Apple for accurate information. Also, for Android users. The Galaxy buds by Samsung feature active noise cancellation & wireless charging case on every model so you might want to look into that product before making a final purchase.Battery life: For optimal battery life, I highly recommend charging both AirPods inside the case. The case itself is a battery pack with a life. So if one or both AirPods are low on battery, you can toss them in the case and charge them up. Apple I believe rates 5 minutes of charging time is equivalent to 1 hour of talk/listening time and 15 minutes of charging time is equivalent to 2 hours of talk/listening. I'm sure this is accurate when they're brand new but I'm sure like anything, normal ware & tare might diminish that over time.Warranty: Apple provides a 1-year standard manufacturer's warranty on this product. This ONLY covers defects/defaults from the manufacturer. This will NOT cover physical and/or liquid damages to AirPods, case, or charging cable included.AppleCare: It's $29.00 and 2 years and well worth the extra money. You're already spending this kind of money on a headset, may as well have protection. We get it, accidents happen! But protect yourself and get your AirPods repaired/replaced at no additional cost to YOU! There is no additional fees or deductibles involved.AppleCare tips:You don't have to install AppleCare right away. You have 60 days from the original purchase date to contact Apple by providing your AirPods serial number (on outside of the box) and Apple will tell you if you're still eligible.You can renew AppleCare for another 2 years for the same fee of $29.00 provided you want to keep the same product. If you decide to upgrade to the AirPods Pro or whatever the latest model is, you would have to purchase AppleCare for that specific product.You can go into an Apple store location and get live repair/replacement on your AirPods.Using AirPods with Android:Apple has allowed Android and other non-iOS devices to use AirPods since the AirPods pair/connect via BlueTooth.If you're using AirPods on an Android platform such as Samsung or LG for example there's 2 ways to pair the headset to your device. You either turn on BlueTooth on your device, pop both AirPods inside your ear, find ""AirPods"" under available connections, and connect. Or you might have to pair manually using the button on the AirPods case to make available, pair, and connect.FAIR WARNING:You will NOT have access to all features that the AirPods have to offer on an Apple/iOS device. You will be limited on functions you can perform.I was able to find an app on Google play store for $1.99 called ""AirPopUp"". It is a paid application that unlock access to certain/more features of the AirPods similar to what an Apple/iOS device would be granted. Be aware that you will NOT have access nor the ability to have every single feature since you're not on Apple's network. There may be other apps (most likely paid applications) you'd have to find that may unlock more features such as: AirPods battery life percentage, case battery life percentage, programming LEFT & RIGHT AirPods for certain function(s), skipping/pausing/resetting songs, answer/decline/hang up phone calls, find my AirPods, and more.For Samsung users specifically, you might want to look into the Galaxy Buds. They're a little cheaper than AirPods, I believe Amazon has them for $109.99 + $22 3-Year insurance through Assurion that does cover physical/liquid/accidental damage just like AirPods.Galaxy Buds features:Made by SamsungAudio powered by AKGRubber ear bud tipsPair with Samsung device to get the mostWireless charging caseActive noise cancellationComes in multiple colors (black/white/silver/yellow/red & black combo with Star Wars edition Galaxy Note 10+)Includes changing cord and replacement rubber earbud tips.I know if you pair the Galaxy Buds with a Samsung device it will automatically download an application titled ""Galaxy Wearable"". This allows users to check battery life status of the case and each bud, prompts you for software updates, ability to program LEFT & RIGHT earbuds to do certain function(s), answer/decline/hang up phone calls, pause/skip/reset songs.Apple may charge a lot of money for their products on accessories but they never fall short of being a revolutionary, well-designed, reliable product that works as advertised."
"I’ll list a few things I think are Good, and What’s Not So Great.The Good: Ummm…Owning an iPhone and a Apple Watch I already have a few lightning cables lying around.Not So Great: The cost. They are not inexpensive. I think I got the cheapest pair and that comes with a wired charging case and really not that impressive of features or sound quality. I am not that thrilled with the fact that the right one went “out” on me. I had to google a remedy for that issue. I believe it involved cleaning them and re-pairing them with my devices. It just wasn’t what I expected from Apple. I’m not thrilled with the fit and comfort. I, honestly, have to CoNsTaNtLy mess with the fit so I can EVeN HeAr TheM. I find that to be pretty unacceptable. If they are pushed in to far, I can’t hear them at all. I need to position them just right (up, down, depth, and turned in my ear at the correct angle) so I can hear them. If I’m talking, chewing, or otherwise moving…forget about it, they’re as useless as my nipples. It’s stupid to have to keep messing with them so I can hear them. “Ain’t Nobody Got Time For That!” I’m kinda wishing I would have bought the Amazon Echo earbuds. Alexa is vastly superior to Siri and I’m hoping that the use ability and fit will be better."
I don’t know what took me so long to get a pair of AirPods. It’s so nice to not worry about chords getting tangled up and broken. My only complaint is that they do get a bit uncomfortable after a few hours of wearing them (I do have pretty small ears though). The silicone tips on the pros probably would be much more comfortable but I didn’t feel like spending the extra money.
I’m going to give this a 5 because I was able to get apple care for the product which put the fake theory to rest… And that was purchased through Apple directly 🙄 but I was pissed that I had to get the right one replaced because it wouldn’t connect. It’s was replaced through apple… so that also confirmed it not fake ❤️

One thing about the apple version of these that I love is that they prompt you to set up as soon as you open them meaning no confusing product orientation.  I take them everywhere I go and since I love the apple headphone shape these are great for work and I use them for running as well.

I thought the product might have been a fake or not real, but I assure you it is. The battery life is just awesome. I can use these anytime of day and travel with them. The product just has a premium feel to them. I love it!"

"I've had my AirPods for over a year now, and I have to say, I'm still impressed with their quality and performance. I've used them for everything from phone calls and video chats to working out and listening to music, and they've never let me down.Pros:Effortless setup: Connecting the AirPods to my iPhone was a breeze. All I had to do was open the case near my phone and it automatically prompted me to connect.Great sound quality: The sound is crisp and clear, and I never have any trouble hearing my calls or music.Good battery life: I can wear them all day without needing to charge them.Good charging case: The case is small and easy to carry around, and it charges the AirPods quickly.Cons:Price: At this price the AirPods are not cheap, but I think they're worth the investment for their quality and convenience. I also have a set of cheap wireless headphones that work great, so only spend the money if you have it.I also bought a cute pink case for my AirPods and it's perfect. It keeps my AirPods safe and secure, and it makes it easy to spot them in my bag.Overall, I'm very happy with my AirPods and I would definitely recommend them to anyone looking for a high-quality, convenient pair of wireless earbuds."
"Taking the Apple AirPods at face value, they're a solid headset for the money! If you already have the original, first generation AirPods and just want to upgrade, not a bad option either. The 2nd generation AirPods feature an improved software chip & runs off of BlueTooth 5.0 vs 4.1 (Gen 1). The software chip allows a faster, stronger, and more stable connection with your device(s). This particular item for $139.00 does NOT feature the wireless charging case. This one must be plugged in via USB (cable provided in the box) to an outlet or USB port. The wireless charging case model is $169. Now if you're looking to upgrade to the wireless charging case later on, you can. Apple does sell it separately. If you want the wireless charging option right out of the box, I recommend sending the $169 vs the $139 product here.Sound quality: Straight out of the box, sound is pretty solid. No crackles, static, pops, or any abnormal noises created by the more economic-friendly headsets. You have a lot more adjustability & tuning capabilities if paired on an iOS/Apple device vs using for example paired with an Android OS device. So, ultimately Apple users may or may not get a better sound quality experience.Noise cancellation: AirPods do fit fairly well in the ear without having to be jammed inside your ear canal. Generally they create a snug fit using Apple's ""universal"" earphone design, it is one size fits most not one size fits all. Some users have upgraded or opted to spend the additional funds on a set of AirPods Pro due to the rubber tips for a better/snug fit. I believe only the AirPods Pro currently has an active noise cancellation utilizing two microphones but I would double-check Apple for accurate information. Also, for Android users. The Galaxy buds by Samsung feature active noise cancellation & wireless charging case on every model so you might want to look into that product before making a final purchase.Battery life: For optimal battery life, I highly recommend charging both AirPods inside the case. The case itself is a battery pack with a life. So if one or both AirPods are low on battery, you can toss them in the case and charge them up. Apple I believe rates 5 minutes of charging time is equivalent to 1 hour of talk/listening time and 15 minutes of charging time is equivalent to 2 hours of talk/listening. I'm sure this is accurate when they're brand new but I'm sure like anything, normal ware & tare might diminish that over time.Warranty: Apple provides a 1-year standard manufacturer's warranty on this product. This ONLY covers defects/defaults from the manufacturer. This will NOT cover physical and/or liquid damages to AirPods, case, or charging cable included.AppleCare: It's $29.00 and 2 years and well worth the extra money. You're already spending this kind of money on a headset, may as well have protection. We get it, accidents happen! But protect yourself and get your AirPods repaired/replaced at no additional cost to YOU! There is no additional fees or deductibles involved.AppleCare tips:You don't have to install AppleCare right away. You have 60 days from the original purchase date to contact Apple by providing your AirPods serial number (on outside of the box) and Apple will tell you if you're still eligible.You can renew AppleCare for another 2 years for the same fee of $29.00 provided you want to keep the same product. If you decide to upgrade to the AirPods Pro or whatever the latest model is, you would have to purchase AppleCare for that specific product.You can go into an Apple store location and get live repair/replacement on your AirPods.Using AirPods with Android:Apple has allowed Android and other non-iOS devices to use AirPods since the AirPods pair/connect via BlueTooth.If you're using AirPods on an Android platform such as Samsung or LG for example there's 2 ways to pair the headset to your device. You either turn on BlueTooth on your device, pop both AirPods inside your ear, find ""AirPods"" under available connections, and connect. Or you might have to pair manually using the button on the AirPods case to make available, pair, and connect.FAIR WARNING:You will NOT have access to all features that the AirPods have to offer on an Apple/iOS device. You will be limited on functions you can perform.I was able to find an app on Google play store for $1.99 called ""AirPopUp"". It is a paid application that unlock access to certain/more features of the AirPods similar to what an Apple/iOS device would be granted. Be aware that you will NOT have access nor the ability to have every single feature since you're not on Apple's network. There may be other apps (most likely paid applications) you'd have to find that may unlock more features such as: AirPods battery life percentage, case battery life percentage, programming LEFT & RIGHT AirPods for certain function(s), skipping/pausing/resetting songs, answer/decline/hang up phone calls, find my AirPods, and more.For Samsung users specifically, you might want to look into the Galaxy Buds. They're a little cheaper than AirPods, I believe Amazon has them for $109.99 + $22 3-Year insurance through Assurion that does cover physical/liquid/accidental damage just like AirPods.Galaxy Buds features:Made by SamsungAudio powered by AKGRubber ear bud tipsPair with Samsung device to get the mostWireless charging caseActive noise cancellationComes in multiple colors (black/white/silver/yellow/red & black combo with Star Wars edition Galaxy Note 10+)Includes changing cord and replacement rubber earbud tips.I know if you pair the Galaxy Buds with a Samsung device it will automatically download an application titled ""Galaxy Wearable"". This allows users to check battery life status of the case and each bud, prompts you for software updates, ability to program LEFT & RIGHT earbuds to do certain function(s), answer/decline/hang up phone calls, pause/skip/reset songs.Apple may charge a lot of money for their products on accessories but they never fall short of being a revolutionary, well-designed, reliable product that works as advertised."
"I’ll list a few things I think are Good, and What’s Not So Great.The Good: Ummm…Owning an iPhone and a Apple Watch I already have a few lightning cables lying around.Not So Great: The cost. They are not inexpensive. I think I got the cheapest pair and that comes with a wired charging case and really not that impressive of features or sound quality. I am not that thrilled with the fact that the right one went “out” on me. I had to google a remedy for that issue. I believe it involved cleaning them and re-pairing them with my devices. It just wasn’t what I expected from Apple. I’m not thrilled with the fit and comfort. I, honestly, have to CoNsTaNtLy mess with the fit so I can EVeN HeAr TheM. I find that to be pretty unacceptable. If they are pushed in to far, I can’t hear them at all. I need to position them just right (up, down, depth, and turned in my ear at the correct angle) so I can hear them. If I’m talking, chewing, or otherwise moving…forget about it, they’re as useless as my nipples. It’s stupid to have to keep messing with them so I can hear them. “Ain’t Nobody Got Time For That!” I’m kinda wishing I would have bought the Amazon Echo earbuds. Alexa is vastly superior to Siri and I’m hoping that the use ability and fit will be better."
I don’t know what took me so long to get a pair of AirPods. It’s so nice to not worry about chords getting tangled up and broken. My only complaint is that they do get a bit uncomfortable after a few hours of wearing them (I do have pretty small ears though). The silicone tips on the pros probably would be much more comfortable but I didn’t feel like spending the extra money.
I’m going to give this a 5 because I was able to get apple care for the product which put the fake theory to rest… And that was purchased through Apple directly 🙄 but I was pissed that I had to get the right one replaced because it wouldn’t connect. It’s was replaced through apple… so that also confirmed it not fake ❤️
One thing about the apple version of these that I love is that they prompt you to set up as soon as you open them meaning no confusing product orientation.  I take them everywhere I go and since I love the apple headphone shape these are great for work and I use them for running as well.
"I love the overall look and feel of this product. The sound quality and audio quality both perform very well. They connect very easily across apple devices and doesn't take much to start using them. I thought the product might have been a fake or not real, but I assure you it is. The battery life is just awesome. I can use these anytime of day and travel with them. The product just has a premium feel to them. I love it!"
I love my AirPods. I thought about getting the AirPods Pro but I didn’t wanna spend that much more just to have the noise canceling feature. Now I will probably upgrade in a year or two now that they’ve even improved the AirPods Pro even more.Coming from somebody who has an iPad and iPhone and an iMac at home having the AirPods and the ability to Switch between them so effortlessly without having to unpair and repair is so nice.I’ve had a number of Bluetooth headsets over the years from Plantronics to generic to a number of other different companies I don’t even know if I could remember every different manufacture that I’ve had. I always hated that they were bulky they never fit in my ear just right. I just never felt like they were great and it was always complicated they seem to fuss to pair up and especially if they ever unpaired then it was starting all over again. I love that the minute that I got my AirPods I flipped open the case and right away my iPhone registers that they are there and with the top of a Button on my phone and the top of the button on the AirPods in a couple of seconds I am paired up.I also have a very nice charger that I bought right here on Amazon for about $25 and it will charge my Apple Pencil my AirPods my Apple Watch and my iPhone all at the same time which is amazing and so nice that I can just click my AirPods case on there and they charge up in a very short time.First off I’m not a sound engineer or an audio file so I can’t say that they have the absolute best sound quality and I’m sure that they don’t I can’t imagine that if you went out and got some of the beads or some other type of wireless headset that fits over your entire ear with a bigger driver in it that of course it’s going to have better sound quality.But I love that they are tiny small and easy to just throw in the case. The battery life is great if my case is fully charged with the AirPods in and charged I can go to complete times to almost dead with both AirPods being used. If I only use one way talking on the phone I can go even more so in between case charging times is sometimes over a week which is absolutely amazing. The talk time on them is very long as well. I’ve never sat down and figured up exactly whether I get the exact time that Apple says.I love that the minute that I put them in my ear I get a nice little tone to let me know that they’ve connected if I’m listening to music and I take them out it automatically pauses. I love that it will even pause my music if I get an iMessage and it will read my message it will tell me who it’s from if they’re in my contact list if not it will read me the phone number and then read me the message and then asked me if I would like to respond all without touching my phone.I love Apple products even if they are a little more expensive in some areas but I love that for instance with the AirPods home they tie Effortlessly Into my phone my Mac and my iPad.I absolutely hate when I am talking on the phone for more than a couple of minutes to have to hold the phone. Also I run a business and so I have to multitask sometimes someone calls and I need to be able to pick up a remote to navigate to something to check I may need to grab the computer etc. and having the ability to have both hands free to do something like that while still talking and not worrying about the AirPods falling out of my ear is worth more than the money that I paid for them by far and then all the other features that come with it are great.So in the end I think that they are amazing and I’ve had it again a number of different Bluetooth headsets and they never fit right they fall out of my ear or the ones that took over my ears are always so uncomfortable after a short period of time that I never ended up using them I always ended up using my wired earbuds that come with my iPhone.
"Had them for 2 years: dropped the case everyday with headphones inside and will continue to do so. It’s very fun throwing the case around it has a good weight to it and feels good in the hands.When the case falls the AirPods eject out and the AirPods are so light that they basically won’t get any fall damage. Good quality audio punchy bass. And amazing microphone very clear with calls.My only gripe was in the first week of use after purchase , I use both iPhone and android and for some reason on the android they were a little annoying with connecting fast but after a week it connected to the android as quickly as it did with the iPhone. You can still pause and play too but you won’t be able to see battery status. No big deal.Battery life and charge up is good.

Read alot of reviews saying fake so wanted to confirm mine are real. Last pair I had for maybe two years? One ear Bud lost its sound quality. Eventually lost the ear buds. Happy to have a new set

"Taking the Apple AirPods at face value, they're a solid headset for the money! If you already have the original, first generation AirPods and just want to upgrade, not a bad option either. The 2nd generation AirPods feature an improved software chip & runs off of BlueTooth 5.0 vs 4.1 (Gen 1). The software chip allows a faster, stronger, and more stable connection with your device(s). This particular item for $139.00 does NOT feature the wireless charging case. This one must be plugged in via USB (cable provided in the box) to an outlet or USB port. The wireless charging case model is $169. Now if you're looking to upgrade to the wireless charging case later on, you can. Apple does sell it separately. If you want the wireless charging option right out of the box, I recommend sending the $169 vs the $139 product here.Sound quality: Straight out of the box, sound is pretty solid. No crackles, static, pops, or any abnormal noises created by the more economic-friendly headsets. You have a lot more adjustability & tuning capabilities if paired on an iOS/Apple device vs using for example paired with an Android OS device. So, ultimately Apple users may or may not get a better sound quality experience.Noise cancellation: AirPods do fit fairly well in the ear without having to be jammed inside your ear canal. Generally they create a snug fit using Apple's ""universal"" earphone design, it is one size fits most not one size fits all. Some users have upgraded or opted to spend the additional funds on a set of AirPods Pro due to the rubber tips for a better/snug fit. I believe only the AirPods Pro currently has an active noise cancellation utilizing two microphones but I would double-check Apple for accurate information. Also, for Android users. The Galaxy buds by Samsung feature active noise cancellation & wireless charging case on every model so you might want to look into that product before making a final purchase.Battery life: For optimal battery life, I highly recommend charging both AirPods inside the case. The case itself is a battery pack with a life. So if one or both AirPods are low on battery, you can toss them in the case and charge them up. Apple I believe rates 5 minutes of charging time is equivalent to 1 hour of talk/listening time and 15 minutes of charging time is equivalent to 2 hours of talk/listening. I'm sure this is accurate when they're brand new but I'm sure like anything, normal ware & tare might diminish that over time.Warranty: Apple provides a 1-year standard manufacturer's warranty on this product. This ONLY covers defects/defaults from the manufacturer. This will NOT cover physical and/or liquid damages to AirPods, case, or charging cable included.AppleCare: It's $29.00 and 2 years and well worth the extra money. You're already spending this kind of money on a headset, may as well have protection. We get it, accidents happen! But protect yourself and get your AirPods repaired/replaced at no additional cost to YOU! There is no additional fees or deductibles involved.AppleCare tips:You don't have to install AppleCare right away. You have 60 days from the original purchase date to contact Apple by providing your AirPods serial number (on outside of the box) and Apple will tell you if you're still eligible.You can renew AppleCare for another 2 years for the same fee of $29.00 provided you want to keep the same product. If you decide to upgrade to the AirPods Pro or whatever the latest model is, you would have to purchase AppleCare for that specific product.You can go into an Apple store location and get live repair/replacement on your AirPods.Using AirPods with Android:Apple has allowed Android and other non-iOS devices to use AirPods since the AirPods pair/connect via BlueTooth.If you're using AirPods on an Android platform such as Samsung or LG for example there's 2 ways to pair the headset to your device. You either turn on BlueTooth on your device, pop both AirPods inside your ear, find ""AirPods"" under available connections, and connect. Or you might have to pair manually using the button on the AirPods case to make available, pair, and connect.FAIR WARNING:You will NOT have access to all features that the AirPods have to offer on an Apple/iOS device. You will be limited on functions you can perform.I was able to find an app on Google play store for $1.99 called ""AirPopUp"". It is a paid application that unlock access to certain/more features of the AirPods similar to what an Apple/iOS device would be granted. Be aware that you will NOT have access nor the ability to have every single feature since you're not on Apple's network. There may be other apps (most likely paid applications) you'd have to find that may unlock more features such as: AirPods battery life percentage, case battery life percentage, programming LEFT & RIGHT AirPods for certain function(s), skipping/pausing/resetting songs, answer/decline/hang up phone calls, find my AirPods, and more.For Samsung users specifically, you might want to look into the Galaxy Buds. They're a little cheaper than AirPods, I believe Amazon has them for $109.99 + $22 3-Year insurance through Assurion that does cover physical/liquid/accidental damage just like AirPods.Galaxy Buds features:Made by SamsungAudio powered by AKGRubber ear bud tipsPair with Samsung device to get the mostWireless charging caseActive noise cancellationComes in multiple colors (black/white/silver/yellow/red & black combo with Star Wars edition Galaxy Note 10+)Includes changing cord and replacement rubber earbud tips.I know if you pair the Galaxy Buds with a Samsung device it will automatically download an application titled ""Galaxy Wearable"".

"I’ll list a few things I think are Good, and What’s Not So Great.The Good: Ummm…Owning an iPhone and a Apple Watch I already have a few lightning cables lying around.Not So Great: The cost. They are not inexpensive. I think I got the cheapest pair and that comes with a wired charging case and really not that impressive of features or sound quality. I am not that thrilled with the fact that the right one went “out” on me. I had to google a remedy for that issue. I believe it involved cleaning them and re-pairing them with my devices. It just wasn’t what I expected from Apple. I’m not thrilled with the fit and comfort. I, honestly, have to CoNsTaNtLy mess with the fit so I can EVeN HeAr TheM. I find that to be pretty unacceptable. If they are pushed in to far, I can’t hear them at all. I need to position them just right (up, down, depth, and turned in my ear at the correct angle) so I can hear them. If I’m talking, chewing, or otherwise moving…forget about it, they’re as useless as my nipples. It’s stupid to have to keep messing with them so I can hear them. “Ain’t Nobody Got Time For That!” I’m kinda wishing I would have bought the Amazon Echo earbuds.

I don’t know what took me so long to get a pair of AirPods. It’s so nice to not worry about chords getting tangled up and broken. My only complaint is that they do get a bit uncomfortable after a few hours of wearing them (I do have pretty small ears though). The silicone tips on the pros probably would be much more comfortable but I didn’t feel like spending the extra money.

The Galaxy buds by Samsung feature active noise cancellation & wireless charging case on every model so you might want to look into that product before making a final purchase.Battery life: For optimal battery life, I highly recommend charging both AirPods inside the case. The case itself is a battery pack with a life. So if one or both AirPods are low on battery, you can toss them in the case and charge them up. Apple I believe rates 5 minutes of charging time is equivalent to 1 hour of talk/listening time and 15 minutes of charging time is equivalent to 2 hours of talk/listening. I'm sure this is accurate when they're brand new but I'm sure like anything, normal ware & tare might diminish that over time.Warranty: Apple provides a 1-year standard manufacturer's warranty on this product. This ONLY covers defects/defaults from the manufacturer. This will NOT cover physical and/or liquid damages to AirPods, case, or charging cable included.AppleCare: It's $29.00 and 2 years and well worth the extra money. You're already spending this kind of money on a headset, may as well have protection. We get it, accidents happen! But protect yourself and get your AirPods repaired/replaced at no additional cost to YOU! There is no additional fees or deductibles involved.AppleCare tips:You don't have to install AppleCare right away. You have 60 days from the original purchase date to contact Apple by providing your AirPods serial number (on outside of the box) and Apple will tell you if you're still eligible.You can renew AppleCare for another 2 years for the same fee of $29.00 provided you want to keep the same product. If you decide to upgrade to the AirPods Pro or whatever the latest model is, you would have to purchase AppleCare for that specific product.You can go into an Apple store location and get live repair/replacement on your AirPods.Using AirPods with Android:Apple has allowed Android and other non-iOS devices to use AirPods since the AirPods pair/connect via BlueTooth.If you're using AirPods on an Android platform such as Samsung or LG for example there's 2 ways to pair the headset to your device. You either turn on BlueTooth on your device, pop both AirPods inside your ear, find ""AirPods"" under available connections, and connect. Or you might have to pair manually using the button on the AirPods case to make available, pair, and connect.FAIR WARNING:You will NOT have access to all features that the AirPods have to offer on an Apple/iOS device. You will be limited on functions you can perform.I was able to find an app on Google play store for $1.99 called ""AirPopUp"". It is a paid application that unlock access to certain/more features of the AirPods similar to what an Apple/iOS device would be granted. Be aware that you will NOT have access nor the ability to have every single feature since you're not on Apple's network. There may be other apps (most likely paid applications) you'd have to find that may unlock more features such as: AirPods battery life percentage, case battery life percentage, programming LEFT & RIGHT AirPods for certain function(s), skipping/pausing/resetting songs, answer/decline/hang up phone calls, find my AirPods, and more.For Samsung users specifically, you might want to look into the Galaxy Buds. They're a little cheaper than AirPods, I believe Amazon has them for $109.99 + $22 3-Year insurance through Assurion that does cover physical/liquid/accidental damage just like AirPods.Galaxy Buds features:Made by SamsungAudio powered by AKGRubber ear bud tipsPair with Samsung device to get the mostWireless charging caseActive noise cancellationComes in multiple colors (black/white/silver/yellow/red & black combo with Star Wars edition Galaxy Note 10+)Includes changing cord and replacement rubber earbud tips.I know if you pair the Galaxy Buds with a Samsung device it will automatically download an application titled ""Galaxy Wearable"". This allows users to check battery life status of the case and each bud, prompts you for software updates, ability to program LEFT & RIGHT earbuds to do certain function(s), answer/decline/hang up phone calls, pause/skip/reset songs.Apple may charge a lot of money for their products on accessories but they never fall short of being a revolutionary, well-designed, reliable product that works as advertised."
"I’ll list a few things I think are Good, and What’s Not So Great.The Good: Ummm…Owning an iPhone and a Apple Watch I already have a few lightning cables lying around.Not So Great: The cost. They are not inexpensive. I think I got the cheapest pair and that comes with a wired charging case and really not that impressive of features or sound quality. I am not that thrilled with the fact that the right one went “out” on me. I had to google a remedy for that issue. I believe it involved cleaning them and re-pairing them with my devices. It just wasn’t what I expected from Apple. I’m not thrilled with the fit and comfort. I, honestly, have to CoNsTaNtLy mess with the fit so I can EVeN HeAr TheM. I find that to be pretty unacceptable. If they are pushed in to far, I can’t hear them at all. I need to position them just right (up, down, depth, and turned in my ear at the correct angle) so I can hear them. If I’m talking, chewing, or otherwise moving…forget about it, they’re as useless as my nipples. It’s stupid to have to keep messing with them so I can hear them. “Ain’t Nobody Got Time For That!” I’m kinda wishing I would have bought the Amazon Echo earbuds. Alexa is vastly superior to Siri and I’m hoping that the use ability and fit will be better."
I don’t know what took me so long to get a pair of AirPods. It’s so nice to not worry about chords getting tangled up and broken. My only complaint is that they do get a bit uncomfortable after a few hours of wearing them (I do have pretty small ears though). The silicone tips on the pros probably would be much more comfortable but I didn’t feel like spending the extra money.
I’m going to give this a 5 because I was able to get apple care for the product which put the fake theory to rest… And that was purchased through Apple directly 🙄 but I was pissed that I had to get the right one replaced because it wouldn’t connect. It’s was replaced through apple… so that also confirmed it not fake ❤️
"Had them for 2 years: dropped the case everyday with headphones inside and will continue to do so. It’s very fun throwing the case around it has a good weight to it and feels good in the hands.When the case falls the AirPods eject out and the AirPods are so light that they basically won’t get any fall damage. Good quality audio punchy bass. And amazing microphone very clear with calls.My only gripe was in the first week of use after purchase , I use both iPhone and android and for some reason on the android they were a little annoying with connecting fast but after a week it connected to the android as quickly as it did with the iPhone. You can still pause and play too but you won’t be able to see battery status. No big deal.Battery life and charge up is good. Expect 6 to 8 hours of playtime and charges up in like 5 minutes for 20~30 min play time. I leave these in my car when it’s hot as hell and the battery is still fine surprisingly. I don’t remember if these come with a cable or not but the apple charger cables  are complete trash and will stop working but yea that’s apple for you.  The headphones look  ugly at first  because it seems too long but you get used to to the look after a week or twoIf you lose the AirPods tho you better hope you have iPhone, not sure if android has an app to locate them but honestly these aren’t easy to lose as they didn’t fall out of my ears and you can exercise with them as well and sweat with them. Just don’t forget putting them back in your case when you're doneCase is prone to getting dirty by design but no biggieI’m an apple hater and I I approve these headphones.Def buying these again if I need to."
"I've had my AirPods for over a year now, and I have to say, I'm still impressed with their quality and performance. I've used them for everything from phone calls and video chats to working out and listening to music, and they've never let me down.Pros:Effortless setup: Connecting the AirPods to my iPhone was a breeze. All I had to do was open the case near my phone and it automatically prompted me to connect.Great sound quality: The sound is crisp and clear, and I never have any trouble hearing my calls or music.Good battery life: I can wear them all day without needing to charge them.Good charging case: The case is small and easy to carry around, and it charges the AirPods quickly.Cons:Price: At this price the AirPods are not cheap, but I think they're worth the investment for their quality and convenience. I also have a set of cheap wireless headphones that work great, so only spend the money if you have it.I also bought a cute pink case for my AirPods and it's perfect. It keeps my AirPods safe and secure, and it makes it easy to spot them in my bag.Overall, I'm very happy with my AirPods and I would definitely recommend them to anyone looking for a high-quality, convenient pair of wireless earbuds."
"Taking the Apple AirPods at face value, they're a solid headset for the money! If you already have the original, first generation AirPods and just want to upgrade, not a bad option either. The 2nd generation AirPods feature an improved software chip & runs off of BlueTooth 5.0 vs 4.1 (Gen 1). The software chip allows a faster, stronger, and more stable connection with your device(s). This particular item for $139.00 does NOT feature the wireless charging case. This one must be plugged in via USB (cable provided in the box) to an outlet or USB port. The wireless charging case model is $169. Now if you're looking to upgrade to the wireless charging case later on, you can. Apple does sell it separately. If you want the wireless charging option right out of the box, I recommend sending the $169 vs the $139 product here.Sound quality: Straight out of the box, sound is pretty solid. No crackles, static, pops, or any abnormal noises created by the more economic-friendly headsets. You have a lot more adjustability & tuning capabilities if paired on an iOS/Apple device vs using for example paired with an Android OS device. So, ultimately Apple users may or may not get a better sound quality experience.Noise cancellation: AirPods do fit fairly well in the ear without having to be jammed inside your ear canal. Generally they create a snug fit using Apple's ""universal"" earphone design, it is one size fits most not one size fits all. Some users have upgraded or opted to spend the additional funds on a set of AirPods Pro due to the rubber tips for a better/snug fit.

One thing about the apple version of these that I love is that they prompt you to set up as soon as you open them meaning no confusing product orientation.  I take them everywhere I go and since I love the apple headphone shape these are great for work and I use them for running as well.

I'm sure this is accurate when they're brand new but I'm sure like anything, normal ware & tare might diminish that over time.Warranty: Apple provides a 1-year standard manufacturer's warranty on this product. This ONLY covers defects/defaults from the manufacturer. This will NOT cover physical and/or liquid damages to AirPods, case, or charging cable included.AppleCare: It's $29.00 and 2 years and well worth the extra money. You're already spending this kind of money on a headset, may as well have protection. We get it, accidents happen! But protect yourself and get your AirPods repaired/replaced at no additional cost to YOU! There is no additional fees or deductibles involved.AppleCare tips:You don't have to install AppleCare right away. You have 60 days from the original purchase date to contact Apple by providing your AirPods serial number (on outside of the box) and Apple will tell you if you're still eligible.You can renew AppleCare for another 2 years for the same fee of $29.00 provided you want to keep the same product. If you decide to upgrade to the AirPods Pro or whatever the latest model is, you would have to purchase AppleCare for that specific product.You can go into an Apple store location and get live repair/replacement on your AirPods.Using AirPods with Android:Apple has allowed Android and other non-iOS devices to use AirPods since the AirPods pair/connect via BlueTooth.If you're using AirPods on an Android platform such as Samsung or LG for example there's 2 ways to pair the headset to your device. You either turn on BlueTooth on your device, pop both AirPods inside your ear, find ""AirPods"" under available connections, and connect. Or you might have to pair manually using the button on the AirPods case to make available, pair, and connect.FAIR WARNING:You will NOT have access to all features that the AirPods have to offer on an Apple/iOS device. You will be limited on functions you can perform.I was able to find an app on Google play store for $1.99 called ""AirPopUp"". It is a paid application that unlock access to certain/more features of the AirPods similar to what an Apple/iOS device would be granted. Be aware that you will NOT have access nor the ability to have every single feature since you're not on Apple's network. There may be other apps (most likely paid applications) you'd have to find that may unlock more features such as: AirPods battery life percentage, case battery life percentage, programming LEFT & RIGHT AirPods for certain function(s), skipping/pausing/resetting songs, answer/decline/hang up phone calls, find my AirPods, and more.For Samsung users specifically, you might want to look into the Galaxy Buds. They're a little cheaper than AirPods, I believe Amazon has them for $109.99 + $22 3-Year insurance through Assurion that does cover physical/liquid/accidental damage just like AirPods.Galaxy Buds features:Made by SamsungAudio powered by AKGRubber ear bud tipsPair with Samsung device to get the mostWireless charging caseActive noise cancellationComes in multiple colors (black/white/silver/yellow/red & black combo with Star Wars edition Galaxy Note 10+)Includes changing cord and replacement rubber earbud tips.I know if you pair the Galaxy Buds with a Samsung device it will automatically download an application titled ""Galaxy Wearable"". This allows users to check battery life status of the case and each bud, prompts you for software updates, ability to program LEFT & RIGHT earbuds to do certain function(s), answer/decline/hang up phone calls, pause/skip/reset songs.Apple may charge a lot of money for their products on accessories but they never fall short of being a revolutionary, well-designed, reliable product that works as advertised."
"I’ll list a few things I think are Good, and What’s Not So Great.The Good: Ummm…Owning an iPhone and a Apple Watch I already have a few lightning cables lying around.Not So Great: The cost. They are not inexpensive. I think I got the cheapest pair and that comes with a wired charging case and really not that impressive of features or sound quality. I am not that thrilled with the fact that the right one went “out” on me. I had to google a remedy for that issue. I believe it involved cleaning them and re-pairing them with my devices. It just wasn’t what I expected from Apple. I’m not thrilled with the fit and comfort. I, honestly, have to CoNsTaNtLy mess with the fit so I can EVeN HeAr TheM. I find that to be pretty unacceptable. If they are pushed in to far, I can’t hear them at all. I need to position them just right (up, down, depth, and turned in my ear at the correct angle) so I can hear them. If I’m talking, chewing, or otherwise moving…forget about it, they’re as useless as my nipples. It’s stupid to have to keep messing with them so I can hear them. “Ain’t Nobody Got Time For That!” I’m kinda wishing I would have bought the Amazon Echo earbuds. Alexa is vastly superior to Siri and I’m hoping that the use ability and fit will be better."
I don’t know what took me so long to get a pair of AirPods. It’s so nice to not worry about chords getting tangled up and broken. My only complaint is that they do get a bit uncomfortable after a few hours of wearing them (I do have pretty small ears though). The silicone tips on the pros probably would be much more comfortable but I didn’t feel like spending the extra money.
I’m going to give this a 5 because I was able to get apple care for the product which put the fake theory to rest… And that was purchased through Apple directly 🙄 but I was pissed that I had to get the right one replaced because it wouldn’t connect. It’s was replaced through apple… so that also confirmed it not fake ❤️
One thing about the apple version of these that I love is that they prompt you to set up as soon as you open them meaning no confusing product orientation.  I take them everywhere I go and since I love the apple headphone shape these are great for work and I use them for running as well.
"I love the overall look and feel of this product. The sound quality and audio quality both perform very well. They connect very easily across apple devices and doesn't take much to start using them. I thought the product might have been a fake or not real, but I assure you it is. The battery life is just awesome. I can use these anytime of day and travel with them. The product just has a premium feel to them. I love it!"
I love my AirPods. I thought about getting the AirPods Pro but I didn’t wanna spend that much more just to have the noise canceling feature. Now I will probably upgrade in a year or two now that they’ve even improved the AirPods Pro even more.Coming from somebody who has an iPad and iPhone and an iMac at home having the AirPods and the ability to Switch between them so effortlessly without having to unpair and repair is so nice.I’ve had a number of Bluetooth headsets over the years from Plantronics to generic to a number of other different companies I don’t even know if I could remember every different manufacture that I’ve had. I always hated that they were bulky they never fit in my ear just right. I just never felt like they were great and it was always complicated they seem to fuss to pair up and especially if they ever unpaired then it was starting all over again. I love that the minute that I got my AirPods I flipped open the case and right away my iPhone registers that they are there and with the top of a Button on my phone and the top of the button on the AirPods in a couple of seconds I am paired up.I also have a very nice charger that I bought right here on Amazon for about $25 and it will charge my Apple Pencil my AirPods my Apple Watch and my iPhone all at the same time which is amazing and so nice that I can just click my AirPods case on there and they charge up in a very short time.First off I’m not a sound engineer or an audio file so I can’t say that they have the absolute best sound quality and I’m sure that they don’t I can’t imagine that if you went out and got some of the beads or some other type of wireless headset that fits over your entire ear with a bigger driver in it that of course it’s going to have better sound quality.But I love that they are tiny small and easy to just throw in the case. The battery life is great if my case is fully charged with the AirPods in and charged I can go to complete times to almost dead with both AirPods being used. If I only use one way talking on the phone I can go even more so in between case charging times is sometimes over a week which is absolutely amazing. The talk time on them is very long as well. I’ve never sat down and figured up exactly whether I get the exact time that Apple says.I love that the minute that I put them in my ear I get a nice little tone to let me know that they’ve connected if I’m listening to music and I take them out it automatically pauses. I love that it will even pause my music if I get an iMessage and it will read my message it will tell me who it’s from if they’re in my contact list if not it will read me the phone number and then read me the message and then asked me if I would like to respond all without touching my phone.I love Apple products even if they are a little more expensive in some areas but I love that for instance with the AirPods home they tie Effortlessly Into my phone my Mac and my iPad.I absolutely hate when I am talking on the phone for more than a couple of minutes to have to hold the phone. Also I run a business and so I have to multitask sometimes someone calls and I need to be able to pick up a remote to navigate to something to check I may need to grab the computer etc. and having the ability to have both hands free to do something like that while still talking and not worrying about the AirPods falling out of my ear is worth more than the money that I paid for them by far and then all the other features that come with it are great.So in the end I think that they are amazing and I’ve had it again a number of different Bluetooth headsets and they never fit right they fall out of my ear or the ones that took over my ears are always so uncomfortable after a short period of time that I never ended up using them I always ended up using my wired earbuds that come with my iPhone.
"Had them for 2 years: dropped the case everyday with headphones inside and will continue to do so. It’s very fun throwing the case around it has a good weight to it and feels good in the hands.When the case falls the AirPods eject out and the AirPods are so light that they basically won’t get any fall damage. Good quality audio punchy bass. And amazing microphone very clear with calls.My only gripe was in the first week of use after purchase , I use both iPhone and android and for some reason on the android they were a little annoying with connecting fast but after a week it connected to the android as quickly as it did with the iPhone. You can still pause and play too but you won’t be able to see battery status. No big deal.Battery life and charge up is good. Expect 6 to 8 hours of playtime and charges up in like 5 minutes for 20~30 min play time. I leave these in my car when it’s hot as hell and the battery is still fine surprisingly. I don’t remember if these come with a cable or not but the apple charger cables  are complete trash and will stop working but yea that’s apple for you.  The headphones look  ugly at first  because it seems too long but you get used to to the look after a week or twoIf you lose the AirPods tho you better hope you have iPhone, not sure if android has an app to locate them but honestly these aren’t easy to lose as they didn’t fall out of my ears and you can exercise with them as well and sweat with them. Just don’t forget putting them back in your case when you're doneCase is prone to getting dirty by design but no biggieI’m an apple hater and I I approve these headphones.Def buying these again if I need to."
"I've had my AirPods for over a year now, and I have to say, I'm still impressed with their quality and performance. I've used them for everything from phone calls and video chats to working out and listening to music, and they've never let me down.Pros:Effortless setup: Connecting the AirPods to my iPhone was a breeze. All I had to do was open the case near my phone and it automatically prompted me to connect.Great sound quality: The sound is crisp and clear, and I never have any trouble hearing my calls or music.Good battery life: I can wear them all day without needing to charge them.Good charging case: The case is small and easy to carry around, and it charges the AirPods quickly.Cons:Price: At this price the AirPods are not cheap, but I think they're worth the investment for their quality and convenience. I also have a set of cheap wireless headphones that work great, so only spend the money if you have it.I also bought a cute pink case for my AirPods and it's perfect. It keeps my AirPods safe and secure, and it makes it easy to spot them in my bag.Overall, I'm very happy with my AirPods and I would definitely recommend them to anyone looking for a high-quality, convenient pair of wireless earbuds."
"Taking the Apple AirPods at face value, they're a solid headset for the money! If you already have the original, first generation AirPods and just want to upgrade, not a bad option either. The 2nd generation AirPods feature an improved software chip & runs off of BlueTooth 5.0 vs 4.1 (Gen 1). The software chip allows a faster, stronger, and more stable connection with your device(s). This particular item for $139.00 does NOT feature the wireless charging case. This one must be plugged in via USB (cable provided in the box) to an outlet or USB port. The wireless charging case model is $169. Now if you're looking to upgrade to the wireless charging case later on, you can. Apple does sell it separately. If you want the wireless charging option right out of the box, I recommend sending the $169 vs the $139 product here.Sound quality: Straight out of the box, sound is pretty solid. No crackles, static, pops, or any abnormal noises created by the more economic-friendly headsets. You have a lot more adjustability & tuning capabilities if paired on an iOS/Apple device vs using for example paired with an Android OS device. So, ultimately Apple users may or may not get a better sound quality experience.Noise cancellation: AirPods do fit fairly well in the ear without having to be jammed inside your ear canal. Generally they create a snug fit using Apple's ""universal"" earphone design, it is one size fits most not one size fits all. Some users have upgraded or opted to spend the additional funds on a set of AirPods Pro due to the rubber tips for a better/snug fit. I believe only the AirPods Pro currently has an active noise cancellation utilizing two microphones but I would double-check Apple for accurate information. Also, for Android users. The Galaxy buds by Samsung feature active noise cancellation & wireless charging case on every model so you might want to look into that product before making a final purchase.Battery life: For optimal battery life, I highly recommend charging both AirPods inside the case. The case itself is a battery pack with a life. So if one or both AirPods are low on battery, you can toss them in the case and charge them up. Apple I believe rates 5 minutes of charging time is equivalent to 1 hour of talk/listening time and 15 minutes of charging time is equivalent to 2 hours of talk/listening.

Read alot of reviews saying fake so wanted to confirm mine are real. Last pair I had for maybe two years? One ear Bud lost its sound quality. Eventually lost the ear buds. Happy to have a new set

Generally they create a snug fit using Apple's ""universal"" earphone design, it is one size fits most not one size fits all. Some users have upgraded or opted to spend the additional funds on a set of AirPods Pro due to the rubber tips for a better/snug fit. I believe only the AirPods Pro currently has an active noise cancellation utilizing two microphones but I would double-check Apple for accurate information. Also, for Android users. The Galaxy buds by Samsung feature active noise cancellation & wireless charging case on every model so you might want to look into that product before making a final purchase.Battery life: For optimal battery life, I highly recommend charging both AirPods inside the case. The case itself is a battery pack with a life. So if one or both AirPods are low on battery, you can toss them in the case and charge them up. Apple I believe rates 5 minutes of charging time is equivalent to 1 hour of talk/listening time and 15 minutes of charging time is equivalent to 2 hours of talk/listening. I'm sure this is accurate when they're brand new but I'm sure like anything, normal ware & tare might diminish that over time.Warranty: Apple provides a 1-year standard manufacturer's warranty on this product. This ONLY covers defects/defaults from the manufacturer. This will NOT cover physical and/or liquid damages to AirPods, case, or charging cable included.AppleCare: It's $29.00 and 2 years and well worth the extra money. You're already spending this kind of money on a headset, may as well have protection. We get it, accidents happen! But protect yourself and get your AirPods repaired/replaced at no additional cost to YOU! There is no additional fees or deductibles involved.AppleCare tips:You don't have to install AppleCare right away. You have 60 days from the original purchase date to contact Apple by providing your AirPods serial number (on outside of the box) and Apple will tell you if you're still eligible.You can renew AppleCare for another 2 years for the same fee of $29.00 provided you want to keep the same product. If you decide to upgrade to the AirPods Pro or whatever the latest model is, you would have to purchase AppleCare for that specific product.You can go into an Apple store location and get live repair/replacement on your AirPods.Using AirPods with Android:Apple has allowed Android and other non-iOS devices to use AirPods since the AirPods pair/connect via BlueTooth.If you're using AirPods on an Android platform such as Samsung or LG for example there's 2 ways to pair the headset to your device. You either turn on BlueTooth on your device, pop both AirPods inside your ear, find ""AirPods"" under available connections, and connect. Or you might have to pair manually using the button on the AirPods case to make available, pair, and connect.FAIR WARNING:You will NOT have access to all features that the AirPods have to offer on an Apple/iOS device.

"Had them for 2 years: dropped the case everyday with headphones inside and will continue to do so. It’s very fun throwing the case around it has a good weight to it and feels good in the hands.When the case falls the AirPods eject out and the AirPods are so light that they basically won’t get any fall damage. Good quality audio punchy bass. And amazing microphone very clear with calls.My only gripe was in the first week of use after purchase , I use both iPhone and android and for some reason on the android they were a little annoying with connecting fast but after a week it connected to the android as quickly as it did with the iPhone. You can still pause and play too but you won’t be able to see battery status. No big deal.Battery life and charge up is good. Expect 6 to 8 hours of playtime and charges up in like 5 minutes for 20~30 min play time. I leave these in my car when it’s hot as hell and the battery is still fine surprisingly. I don’t remember if these come with a cable or not but the apple charger cables  are complete trash and will stop working but yea that’s apple for you.  The headphones look  ugly at first  because it seems too long but you get used to to the look after a week or twoIf you lose the AirPods tho you better hope you have iPhone, not sure if android has an app to locate them but honestly these aren’t easy to lose as they didn’t fall out of my ears and you can exercise with them as well and sweat with them. Just don’t forget putting them back in your case when you're doneCase is prone to getting dirty by design but no biggieI’m an apple hater and I I approve these headphones.Def buying these again if I need to."
"I've had my AirPods for over a year now, and I have to say, I'm still impressed with their quality and performance. I've used them for everything from phone calls and video chats to working out and listening to music, and they've never let me down.Pros:Effortless setup: Connecting the AirPods to my iPhone was a breeze. All I had to do was open the case near my phone and it automatically prompted me to connect.Great sound quality: The sound is crisp and clear, and I never have any trouble hearing my calls or music.Good battery life: I can wear them all day without needing to charge them.Good charging case: The case is small and easy to carry around, and it charges the AirPods quickly.Cons:Price: At this price the AirPods are not cheap, but I think they're worth the investment for their quality and convenience. I also have a set of cheap wireless headphones that work great, so only spend the money if you have it.I also bought a cute pink case for my AirPods and it's perfect. It keeps my AirPods safe and secure, and it makes it easy to spot them in my bag.Overall, I'm very happy with my AirPods and I would definitely recommend them to anyone looking for a high-quality, convenient pair of wireless earbuds."
"Taking the Apple AirPods at face value, they're a solid headset for the money! If you already have the original, first generation AirPods and just want to upgrade, not a bad option either. The 2nd generation AirPods feature an improved software chip & runs off of BlueTooth 5.0 vs 4.1 (Gen 1). The software chip allows a faster, stronger, and more stable connection with your device(s). This particular item for $139.00 does NOT feature the wireless charging case. This one must be plugged in via USB (cable provided in the box) to an outlet or USB port. The wireless charging case model is $169. Now if you're looking to upgrade to the wireless charging case later on, you can. Apple does sell it separately. If you want the wireless charging option right out of the box, I recommend sending the $169 vs the $139 product here.Sound quality: Straight out of the box, sound is pretty solid. No crackles, static, pops, or any abnormal noises created by the more economic-friendly headsets. You have a lot more adjustability & tuning capabilities if paired on an iOS/Apple device vs using for example paired with an Android OS device. So, ultimately Apple users may or may not get a better sound quality experience.Noise cancellation: AirPods do fit fairly well in the ear without having to be jammed inside your ear canal.

"I’ll list a few things I think are Good, and What’s Not So Great.The Good: Ummm…Owning an iPhone and a Apple Watch I already have a few lightning cables lying around.Not So Great: The cost. They are not inexpensive. I think I got the cheapest pair and that comes with a wired charging case and really not that impressive of features or sound quality. I am not that thrilled with the fact that the right one went “out” on me. I had to google a remedy for that issue. I believe it involved cleaning them and re-pairing them with my devices. It just wasn’t what I expected from Apple. I’m not thrilled with the fit and comfort. I, honestly, have to CoNsTaNtLy mess with the fit so I can EVeN HeAr TheM. I find that to be pretty unacceptable. If they are pushed in to far, I can’t hear them at all. I need to position them just right (up, down, depth, and turned in my ear at the correct angle) so I can hear them. If I’m talking, chewing, or otherwise moving…forget about it, they’re as useless as my nipples.

I don’t know what took me so long to get a pair of AirPods. It’s so nice to not worry about chords getting tangled up and broken. My only complaint is that they do get a bit uncomfortable after a few hours of wearing them (I do have pretty small ears though). The silicone tips on the pros probably would be much more comfortable but I didn’t feel like spending the extra money.

They are not inexpensive. I think I got the cheapest pair and that comes with a wired charging case and really not that impressive of features or sound quality. I am not that thrilled with the fact that the right one went “out” on me. I had to google a remedy for that issue. I believe it involved cleaning them and re-pairing them with my devices. It just wasn’t what I expected from Apple. I’m not thrilled with the fit and comfort. I, honestly, have to CoNsTaNtLy mess with the fit so I can EVeN HeAr TheM. I find that to be pretty unacceptable. If they are pushed in to far, I can’t hear them at all. I need to position them just right (up, down, depth, and turned in my ear at the correct angle) so I can hear them. If I’m talking, chewing, or otherwise moving…forget about it, they’re as useless as my nipples. It’s stupid to have to keep messing with them so I can hear them. “Ain’t Nobody Got Time For That!” I’m kinda wishing I would have bought the Amazon Echo earbuds. Alexa is vastly superior to Siri and I’m hoping that the use ability and fit will be better."
I don’t know what took me so long to get a pair of AirPods. It’s so nice to not worry about chords getting tangled up and broken. My only complaint is that they do get a bit uncomfortable after a few hours of wearing them (I do have pretty small ears though). The silicone tips on the pros probably would be much more comfortable but I didn’t feel like spending the extra money.
I’m going to give this a 5 because I was able to get apple care for the product which put the fake theory to rest… And that was purchased through Apple directly 🙄 but I was pissed that I had to get the right one replaced because it wouldn’t connect. It’s was replaced through apple… so that also confirmed it not fake ❤️
"Had them for 2 years: dropped the case everyday with headphones inside and will continue to do so. It’s very fun throwing the case around it has a good weight to it and feels good in the hands.When the case falls the AirPods eject out and the AirPods are so light that they basically won’t get any fall damage. Good quality audio punchy bass. And amazing microphone very clear with calls.My only gripe was in the first week of use after purchase , I use both iPhone and android and for some reason on the android they were a little annoying with connecting fast but after a week it connected to the android as quickly as it did with the iPhone. You can still pause and play too but you won’t be able to see battery status. No big deal.Battery life and charge up is good. Expect 6 to 8 hours of playtime and charges up in like 5 minutes for 20~30 min play time. I leave these in my car when it’s hot as hell and the battery is still fine surprisingly. I don’t remember if these come with a cable or not but the apple charger cables  are complete trash and will stop working but yea that’s apple for you.  The headphones look  ugly at first  because it seems too long but you get used to to the look after a week or twoIf you lose the AirPods tho you better hope you have iPhone, not sure if android has an app to locate them but honestly these aren’t easy to lose as they didn’t fall out of my ears and you can exercise with them as well and sweat with them. Just don’t forget putting them back in your case when you're doneCase is prone to getting dirty by design but no biggieI’m an apple hater and I I approve these headphones.Def buying these again if I need to."
"I've had my AirPods for over a year now, and I have to say, I'm still impressed with their quality and performance. I've used them for everything from phone calls and video chats to working out and listening to music, and they've never let me down.Pros:Effortless setup: Connecting the AirPods to my iPhone was a breeze. All I had to do was open the case near my phone and it automatically prompted me to connect.Great sound quality: The sound is crisp and clear, and I never have any trouble hearing my calls or music.Good battery life: I can wear them all day without needing to charge them.Good charging case: The case is small and easy to carry around, and it charges the AirPods quickly.Cons:Price: At this price the AirPods are not cheap, but I think they're worth the investment for their quality and convenience. I also have a set of cheap wireless headphones that work great, so only spend the money if you have it.I also bought a cute pink case for my AirPods and it's perfect. It keeps my AirPods safe and secure, and it makes it easy to spot them in my bag.Overall, I'm very happy with my AirPods and I would definitely recommend them to anyone looking for a high-quality, convenient pair of wireless earbuds."
"Taking the Apple AirPods at face value, they're a solid headset for the money! If you already have the original, first generation AirPods and just want to upgrade, not a bad option either. The 2nd generation AirPods feature an improved software chip & runs off of BlueTooth 5.0 vs 4.1 (Gen 1). The software chip allows a faster, stronger, and more stable connection with your device(s). This particular item for $139.00 does NOT feature the wireless charging case. This one must be plugged in via USB (cable provided in the box) to an outlet or USB port. The wireless charging case model is $169. Now if you're looking to upgrade to the wireless charging case later on, you can. Apple does sell it separately. If you want the wireless charging option right out of the box, I recommend sending the $169 vs the $139 product here.Sound quality: Straight out of the box, sound is pretty solid. No crackles, static, pops, or any abnormal noises created by the more economic-friendly headsets. You have a lot more adjustability & tuning capabilities if paired on an iOS/Apple device vs using for example paired with an Android OS device. So, ultimately Apple users may or may not get a better sound quality experience.Noise cancellation: AirPods do fit fairly well in the ear without having to be jammed inside your ear canal. Generally they create a snug fit using Apple's ""universal"" earphone design, it is one size fits most not one size fits all. Some users have upgraded or opted to spend the additional funds on a set of AirPods Pro due to the rubber tips for a better/snug fit. I believe only the AirPods Pro currently has an active noise cancellation utilizing two microphones but I would double-check Apple for accurate information. Also, for Android users. The Galaxy buds by Samsung feature active noise cancellation & wireless charging case on every model so you might want to look into that product before making a final purchase.Battery life: For optimal battery life, I highly recommend charging both AirPods inside the case. The case itself is a battery pack with a life. So if one or both AirPods are low on battery, you can toss them in the case and charge them up. Apple I believe rates 5 minutes of charging time is equivalent to 1 hour of talk/listening time and 15 minutes of charging time is equivalent to 2 hours of talk/listening. I'm sure this is accurate when they're brand new but I'm sure like anything, normal ware & tare might diminish that over time.Warranty: Apple provides a 1-year standard manufacturer's warranty on this product. This ONLY covers defects/defaults from the manufacturer. This will NOT cover physical and/or liquid damages to AirPods, case, or charging cable included.AppleCare: It's $29.00 and 2 years and well worth the extra money. You're already spending this kind of money on a headset, may as well have protection. We get it, accidents happen! But protect yourself and get your AirPods repaired/replaced at no additional cost to YOU! There is no additional fees or deductibles involved.AppleCare tips:You don't have to install AppleCare right away. You have 60 days from the original purchase date to contact Apple by providing your AirPods serial number (on outside of the box) and Apple will tell you if you're still eligible.You can renew AppleCare for another 2 years for the same fee of $29.00 provided you want to keep the same product. If you decide to upgrade to the AirPods Pro or whatever the latest model is, you would have to purchase AppleCare for that specific product.You can go into an Apple store location and get live repair/replacement on your AirPods.Using AirPods with Android:Apple has allowed Android and other non-iOS devices to use AirPods since the AirPods pair/connect via BlueTooth.If you're using AirPods on an Android platform such as Samsung or LG for example there's 2 ways to pair the headset to your device. You either turn on BlueTooth on your device, pop both AirPods inside your ear, find ""AirPods"" under available connections, and connect. Or you might have to pair manually using the button on the AirPods case to make available, pair, and connect.FAIR WARNING:You will NOT have access to all features that the AirPods have to offer on an Apple/iOS device. You will be limited on functions you can perform.I was able to find an app on Google play store for $1.99 called ""AirPopUp"". It is a paid application that unlock access to certain/more features of the AirPods similar to what an Apple/iOS device would be granted. Be aware that you will NOT have access nor the ability to have every single feature since you're not on Apple's network. There may be other apps (most likely paid applications) you'd have to find that may unlock more features such as: AirPods battery life percentage, case battery life percentage, programming LEFT & RIGHT AirPods for certain function(s), skipping/pausing/resetting songs, answer/decline/hang up phone calls, find my AirPods, and more.For Samsung users specifically, you might want to look into the Galaxy Buds. They're a little cheaper than AirPods, I believe Amazon has them for $109.99 + $22 3-Year insurance through Assurion that does cover physical/liquid/accidental damage just like AirPods.Galaxy Buds features:Made by SamsungAudio powered by AKGRubber ear bud tipsPair with Samsung device to get the mostWireless charging caseActive noise cancellationComes in multiple colors (black/white/silver/yellow/red & black combo with Star Wars edition Galaxy Note 10+)Includes changing cord and replacement rubber earbud tips.I know if you pair the Galaxy Buds with a Samsung device it will automatically download an application titled ""Galaxy Wearable"". This allows users to check battery life status of the case and each bud, prompts you for software updates, ability to program LEFT & RIGHT earbuds to do certain function(s), answer/decline/hang up phone calls, pause/skip/reset songs.Apple may charge a lot of money for their products on accessories but they never fall short of being a revolutionary, well-designed, reliable product that works as advertised."

One thing about the apple version of these that I love is that they prompt you to set up as soon as you open them meaning no confusing product orientation.  I take them everywhere I go and since I love the apple headphone shape these are great for work and I use them for running as well.

It just wasn’t what I expected from Apple. I’m not thrilled with the fit and comfort. I, honestly, have to CoNsTaNtLy mess with the fit so I can EVeN HeAr TheM. I find that to be pretty unacceptable. If they are pushed in to far, I can’t hear them at all. I need to position them just right (up, down, depth, and turned in my ear at the correct angle) so I can hear them. If I’m talking, chewing, or otherwise moving…forget about it, they’re as useless as my nipples. It’s stupid to have to keep messing with them so I can hear them. “Ain’t Nobody Got Time For That!” I’m kinda wishing I would have bought the Amazon Echo earbuds. Alexa is vastly superior to Siri and I’m hoping that the use ability and fit will be better."
I don’t know what took me so long to get a pair of AirPods. It’s so nice to not worry about chords getting tangled up and broken. My only complaint is that they do get a bit uncomfortable after a few hours of wearing them (I do have pretty small ears though). The silicone tips on the pros probably would be much more comfortable but I didn’t feel like spending the extra money.
I’m going to give this a 5 because I was able to get apple care for the product which put the fake theory to rest… And that was purchased through Apple directly 🙄 but I was pissed that I had to get the right one replaced because it wouldn’t connect. It’s was replaced through apple… so that also confirmed it not fake ❤️
One thing about the apple version of these that I love is that they prompt you to set up as soon as you open them meaning no confusing product orientation.  I take them everywhere I go and since I love the apple headphone shape these are great for work and I use them for running as well.
"I love the overall look and feel of this product. The sound quality and audio quality both perform very well. They connect very easily across apple devices and doesn't take much to start using them. I thought the product might have been a fake or not real, but I assure you it is. The battery life is just awesome. I can use these anytime of day and travel with them. The product just has a premium feel to them. I love it!"
I love my AirPods. I thought about getting the AirPods Pro but I didn’t wanna spend that much more just to have the noise canceling feature. Now I will probably upgrade in a year or two now that they’ve even improved the AirPods Pro even more.Coming from somebody who has an iPad and iPhone and an iMac at home having the AirPods and the ability to Switch between them so effortlessly without having to unpair and repair is so nice.I’ve had a number of Bluetooth headsets over the years from Plantronics to generic to a number of other different companies I don’t even know if I could remember every different manufacture that I’ve had. I always hated that they were bulky they never fit in my ear just right. I just never felt like they were great and it was always complicated they seem to fuss to pair up and especially if they ever unpaired then it was starting all over again. I love that the minute that I got my AirPods I flipped open the case and right away my iPhone registers that they are there and with the top of a Button on my phone and the top of the button on the AirPods in a couple of seconds I am paired up.I also have a very nice charger that I bought right here on Amazon for about $25 and it will charge my Apple Pencil my AirPods my Apple Watch and my iPhone all at the same time which is amazing and so nice that I can just click my AirPods case on there and they charge up in a very short time.First off I’m not a sound engineer or an audio file so I can’t say that they have the absolute best sound quality and I’m sure that they don’t I can’t imagine that if you went out and got some of the beads or some other type of wireless headset that fits over your entire ear with a bigger driver in it that of course it’s going to have better sound quality.But I love that they are tiny small and easy to just throw in the case. The battery life is great if my case is fully charged with the AirPods in and charged I can go to complete times to almost dead with both AirPods being used. If I only use one way talking on the phone I can go even more so in between case charging times is sometimes over a week which is absolutely amazing. The talk time on them is very long as well. I’ve never sat down and figured up exactly whether I get the exact time that Apple says.I love that the minute that I put them in my ear I get a nice little tone to let me know that they’ve connected if I’m listening to music and I take them out it automatically pauses. I love that it will even pause my music if I get an iMessage and it will read my message it will tell me who it’s from if they’re in my contact list if not it will read me the phone number and then read me the message and then asked me if I would like to respond all without touching my phone.I love Apple products even if they are a little more expensive in some areas but I love that for instance with the AirPods home they tie Effortlessly Into my phone my Mac and my iPad.I absolutely hate when I am talking on the phone for more than a couple of minutes to have to hold the phone. Also I run a business and so I have to multitask sometimes someone calls and I need to be able to pick up a remote to navigate to something to check I may need to grab the computer etc. and having the ability to have both hands free to do something like that while still talking and not worrying about the AirPods falling out of my ear is worth more than the money that I paid for them by far and then all the other features that come with it are great.So in the end I think that they are amazing and I’ve had it again a number of different Bluetooth headsets and they never fit right they fall out of my ear or the ones that took over my ears are always so uncomfortable after a short period of time that I never ended up using them I always ended up using my wired earbuds that come with my iPhone.
"Had them for 2 years: dropped the case everyday with headphones inside and will continue to do so. It’s very fun throwing the case around it has a good weight to it and feels good in the hands.When the case falls the AirPods eject out and the AirPods are so light that they basically won’t get any fall damage. Good quality audio punchy bass. And amazing microphone very clear with calls.My only gripe was in the first week of use after purchase , I use both iPhone and android and for some reason on the android they were a little annoying with connecting fast but after a week it connected to the android as quickly as it did with the iPhone. You can still pause and play too but you won’t be able to see battery status. No big deal.Battery life and charge up is good. Expect 6 to 8 hours of playtime and charges up in like 5 minutes for 20~30 min play time. I leave these in my car when it’s hot as hell and the battery is still fine surprisingly. I don’t remember if these come with a cable or not but the apple charger cables  are complete trash and will stop working but yea that’s apple for you.  The headphones look  ugly at first  because it seems too long but you get used to to the look after a week or twoIf you lose the AirPods tho you better hope you have iPhone, not sure if android has an app to locate them but honestly these aren’t easy to lose as they didn’t fall out of my ears and you can exercise with them as well and sweat with them. Just don’t forget putting them back in your case when you're doneCase is prone to getting dirty by design but no biggieI’m an apple hater and I I approve these headphones.Def buying these again if I need to."
"I've had my AirPods for over a year now, and I have to say, I'm still impressed with their quality and performance. I've used them for everything from phone calls and video chats to working out and listening to music, and they've never let me down.Pros:Effortless setup: Connecting the AirPods to my iPhone was a breeze. All I had to do was open the case near my phone and it automatically prompted me to connect.Great sound quality: The sound is crisp and clear, and I never have any trouble hearing my calls or music.Good battery life: I can wear them all day without needing to charge them.Good charging case: The case is small and easy to carry around, and it charges the AirPods quickly.Cons:Price: At this price the AirPods are not cheap, but I think they're worth the investment for their quality and convenience. I also have a set of cheap wireless headphones that work great, so only spend the money if you have it.I also bought a cute pink case for my AirPods and it's perfect. It keeps my AirPods safe and secure, and it makes it easy to spot them in my bag.Overall, I'm very happy with my AirPods and I would definitely recommend them to anyone looking for a high-quality, convenient pair of wireless earbuds."
"Taking the Apple AirPods at face value, they're a solid headset for the money! If you already have the original, first generation AirPods and just want to upgrade, not a bad option either. The 2nd generation AirPods feature an improved software chip & runs off of BlueTooth 5.0 vs 4.1 (Gen 1). The software chip allows a faster, stronger, and more stable connection with your device(s). This particular item for $139.00 does NOT feature the wireless charging case. This one must be plugged in via USB (cable provided in the box) to an outlet or USB port. The wireless charging case model is $169. Now if you're looking to upgrade to the wireless charging case later on, you can. Apple does sell it separately. If you want the wireless charging option right out of the box, I recommend sending the $169 vs the $139 product here.Sound quality: Straight out of the box, sound is pretty solid. No crackles, static, pops, or any abnormal noises created by the more economic-friendly headsets. You have a lot more adjustability & tuning capabilities if paired on an iOS/Apple device vs using for example paired with an Android OS device. So, ultimately Apple users may or may not get a better sound quality experience.Noise cancellation: AirPods do fit fairly well in the ear without having to be jammed inside your ear canal. Generally they create a snug fit using Apple's ""universal"" earphone design, it is one size fits most not one size fits all. Some users have upgraded or opted to spend the additional funds on a set of AirPods Pro due to the rubber tips for a better/snug fit. I believe only the AirPods Pro currently has an active noise cancellation utilizing two microphones but I would double-check Apple for accurate information. Also, for Android users. The Galaxy buds by Samsung feature active noise cancellation & wireless charging case on every model so you might want to look into that product before making a final purchase.Battery life: For optimal battery life, I highly recommend charging both AirPods inside the case. The case itself is a battery pack with a life. So if one or both AirPods are low on battery, you can toss them in the case and charge them up. Apple I believe rates 5 minutes of charging time is equivalent to 1 hour of talk/listening time and 15 minutes of charging time is equivalent to 2 hours of talk/listening. I'm sure this is accurate when they're brand new but I'm sure like anything, normal ware & tare might diminish that over time.Warranty: Apple provides a 1-year standard manufacturer's warranty on this product. This ONLY covers defects/defaults from the manufacturer. This will NOT cover physical and/or liquid damages to AirPods, case, or charging cable included.AppleCare: It's $29.00 and 2 years and well worth the extra money. You're already spending this kind of money on a headset, may as well have protection. We get it, accidents happen! But protect yourself and get your AirPods repaired/replaced at no additional cost to YOU! There is no additional fees or deductibles involved.AppleCare tips:You don't have to install AppleCare right away. You have 60 days from the original purchase date to contact Apple by providing your AirPods serial number (on outside of the box) and Apple will tell you if you're still eligible.You can renew AppleCare for another 2 years for the same fee of $29.00 provided you want to keep the same product. If you decide to upgrade to the AirPods Pro or whatever the latest model is, you would have to purchase AppleCare for that specific product.You can go into an Apple store location and get live repair/replacement on your AirPods.Using AirPods with Android:Apple has allowed Android and other non-iOS devices to use AirPods since the AirPods pair/connect via BlueTooth.If you're using AirPods on an Android platform such as Samsung or LG for example there's 2 ways to pair the headset to your device. You either turn on BlueTooth on your device, pop both AirPods inside your ear, find ""AirPods"" under available connections, and connect. Or you might have to pair manually using the button on the AirPods case to make available, pair, and connect.FAIR WARNING:You will NOT have access to all features that the AirPods have to offer on an Apple/iOS device. You will be limited on functions you can perform.I was able to find an app on Google play store for $1.99 called ""AirPopUp"". It is a paid application that unlock access to certain/more features of the AirPods similar to what an Apple/iOS device would be granted. Be aware that you will NOT have access nor the ability to have every single feature since you're not on Apple's network. There may be other apps (most likely paid applications) you'd have to find that may unlock more features such as: AirPods battery life percentage, case battery life percentage, programming LEFT & RIGHT AirPods for certain function(s), skipping/pausing/resetting songs, answer/decline/hang up phone calls, find my AirPods, and more.For Samsung users specifically, you might want to look into the Galaxy Buds. They're a little cheaper than AirPods, I believe Amazon has them for $109.99 + $22 3-Year insurance through Assurion that does cover physical/liquid/accidental damage just like AirPods.Galaxy Buds features:Made by SamsungAudio powered by AKGRubber ear bud tipsPair with Samsung device to get the mostWireless charging caseActive noise cancellationComes in multiple colors (black/white/silver/yellow/red & black combo with Star Wars edition Galaxy Note 10+)Includes changing cord and replacement rubber earbud tips.I know if you pair the Galaxy Buds with a Samsung device it will automatically download an application titled ""Galaxy Wearable"". This allows users to check battery life status of the case and each bud, prompts you for software updates, ability to program LEFT & RIGHT earbuds to do certain function(s), answer/decline/hang up phone calls, pause/skip/reset songs.Apple may charge a lot of money for their products on accessories but they never fall short of being a revolutionary, well-designed, reliable product that works as advertised."
"I’ll list a few things I think are Good, and What’s Not So Great.The Good: Ummm…Owning an iPhone and a Apple Watch I already have a few lightning cables lying around.Not So Great: The cost. They are not inexpensive. I think I got the cheapest pair and that comes with a wired charging case and really not that impressive of features or sound quality. I am not that thrilled with the fact that the right one went “out” on me. I had to google a remedy for that issue. I believe it involved cleaning them and re-pairing them with my devices.

Read alot of reviews saying fake so wanted to confirm mine are real. Last pair I had for maybe two years? One ear Bud lost its sound quality. Eventually lost the ear buds. Happy to have a new set

"Had them for 2 years: dropped the case everyday with headphones inside and will continue to do so. It’s very fun throwing the case around it has a good weight to it and feels good in the hands.When the case falls the AirPods eject out and the AirPods are so light that they basically won’t get any fall damage. Good quality audio punchy bass. And amazing microphone very clear with calls.My only gripe was in the first week of use after purchase , I use both iPhone and android and for some reason on the android they were a little annoying with connecting fast but after a week it connected to the android as quickly as it did with the iPhone. You can still pause and play too but you won’t be able to see battery status. No big deal.Battery life and charge up is good. Expect 6 to 8 hours of playtime and charges up in like 5 minutes for 20~30 min play time. I leave these in my car when it’s hot as hell and the battery is still fine surprisingly. I don’t remember if these come with a cable or not but the apple charger cables  are complete trash and will stop working but yea that’s apple for you.  The headphones look  ugly at first  because it seems too long but you get used to to the look after a week or twoIf you lose the AirPods tho you better hope you have iPhone, not sure if android has an app to locate them but honestly these aren’t easy to lose as they didn’t fall out of my ears and you can exercise with them as well and sweat with them. Just don’t forget putting them back in your case when you're doneCase is prone to getting dirty by design but no biggieI’m an apple hater and I I approve these headphones.Def buying these again if I need to."
"I've had my AirPods for over a year now, and I have to say, I'm still impressed with their quality and performance. I've used them for everything from phone calls and video chats to working out and listening to music, and they've never let me down.Pros:Effortless setup: Connecting the AirPods to my iPhone was a breeze. All I had to do was open the case near my phone and it automatically prompted me to connect.Great sound quality: The sound is crisp and clear, and I never have any trouble hearing my calls or music.Good battery life: I can wear them all day without needing to charge them.Good charging case: The case is small and easy to carry around, and it charges the AirPods quickly.Cons:Price: At this price the AirPods are not cheap, but I think they're worth the investment for their quality and convenience. I also have a set of cheap wireless headphones that work great, so only spend the money if you have it.I also bought a cute pink case for my AirPods and it's perfect. It keeps my AirPods safe and secure, and it makes it easy to spot them in my bag.Overall, I'm very happy with my AirPods and I would definitely recommend them to anyone looking for a high-quality, convenient pair of wireless earbuds."
"Taking the Apple AirPods at face value, they're a solid headset for the money! If you already have the original, first generation AirPods and just want to upgrade, not a bad option either. The 2nd generation AirPods feature an improved software chip & runs off of BlueTooth 5.0 vs 4.1 (Gen 1). The software chip allows a faster, stronger, and more stable connection with your device(s). This particular item for $139.00 does NOT feature the wireless charging case. This one must be plugged in via USB (cable provided in the box) to an outlet or USB port. The wireless charging case model is $169. Now if you're looking to upgrade to the wireless charging case later on, you can. Apple does sell it separately. If you want the wireless charging option right out of the box, I recommend sending the $169 vs the $139 product here.Sound quality: Straight out of the box, sound is pretty solid. No crackles, static, pops, or any abnormal noises created by the more economic-friendly headsets. You have a lot more adjustability & tuning capabilities if paired on an iOS/Apple device vs using for example paired with an Android OS device. So, ultimately Apple users may or may not get a better sound quality experience.Noise cancellation: AirPods do fit fairly well in the ear without having to be jammed inside your ear canal. Generally they create a snug fit using Apple's ""universal"" earphone design, it is one size fits most not one size fits all. Some users have upgraded or opted to spend the additional funds on a set of AirPods Pro due to the rubber tips for a better/snug fit. I believe only the AirPods Pro currently has an active noise cancellation utilizing two microphones but I would double-check Apple for accurate information. Also, for Android users. The Galaxy buds by Samsung feature active noise cancellation & wireless charging case on every model so you might want to look into that product before making a final purchase.Battery life: For optimal battery life, I highly recommend charging both AirPods inside the case. The case itself is a battery pack with a life. So if one or both AirPods are low on battery, you can toss them in the case and charge them up. Apple I believe rates 5 minutes of charging time is equivalent to 1 hour of talk/listening time and 15 minutes of charging time is equivalent to 2 hours of talk/listening. I'm sure this is accurate when they're brand new but I'm sure like anything, normal ware & tare might diminish that over time.Warranty: Apple provides a 1-year standard manufacturer's warranty on this product. This ONLY covers defects/defaults from the manufacturer. This will NOT cover physical and/or liquid damages to AirPods, case, or charging cable included.AppleCare: It's $29.00 and 2 years and well worth the extra money. You're already spending this kind of money on a headset, may as well have protection. We get it, accidents happen! But protect yourself and get your AirPods repaired/replaced at no additional cost to YOU! There is no additional fees or deductibles involved.AppleCare tips:You don't have to install AppleCare right away. You have 60 days from the original purchase date to contact Apple by providing your AirPods serial number (on outside of the box) and Apple will tell you if you're still eligible.You can renew AppleCare for another 2 years for the same fee of $29.00 provided you want to keep the same product. If you decide to upgrade to the AirPods Pro or whatever the latest model is, you would have to purchase AppleCare for that specific product.You can go into an Apple store location and get live repair/replacement on your AirPods.Using AirPods with Android:Apple has allowed Android and other non-iOS devices to use AirPods since the AirPods pair/connect via BlueTooth.If you're using AirPods on an Android platform such as Samsung or LG for example there's 2 ways to pair the headset to your device. You either turn on BlueTooth on your device, pop both AirPods inside your ear, find ""AirPods"" under available connections, and connect. Or you might have to pair manually using the button on the AirPods case to make available, pair, and connect.FAIR WARNING:You will NOT have access to all features that the AirPods have to offer on an Apple/iOS device. You will be limited on functions you can perform.I was able to find an app on Google play store for $1.99 called ""AirPopUp"". It is a paid application that unlock access to certain/more features of the AirPods similar to what an Apple/iOS device would be granted. Be aware that you will NOT have access nor the ability to have every single feature since you're not on Apple's network. There may be other apps (most likely paid applications) you'd have to find that may unlock more features such as: AirPods battery life percentage, case battery life percentage, programming LEFT & RIGHT AirPods for certain function(s), skipping/pausing/resetting songs, answer/decline/hang up phone calls, find my AirPods, and more.For Samsung users specifically, you might want to look into the Galaxy Buds. They're a little cheaper than AirPods, I believe Amazon has them for $109.99 + $22 3-Year insurance through Assurion that does cover physical/liquid/accidental damage just like AirPods.Galaxy Buds features:Made by SamsungAudio powered by AKGRubber ear bud tipsPair with Samsung device to get the mostWireless charging caseActive noise cancellationComes in multiple colors (black/white/silver/yellow/red & black combo with Star Wars edition Galaxy Note 10+)Includes changing cord and replacement rubber earbud tips.I know if you pair the Galaxy Buds with a Samsung device it will automatically download an application titled ""Galaxy Wearable"".

"I’ll list a few things I think are Good, and What’s Not So Great.The Good: Ummm…Owning an iPhone and a Apple Watch I already have a few lightning cables lying around.Not So Great: The cost. They are not inexpensive. I think I got the cheapest pair and that comes with a wired charging case and really not that impressive of features or sound quality. I am not that thrilled with the fact that the right one went “out” on me. I had to google a remedy for that issue. I believe it involved cleaning them and re-pairing them with my devices. It just wasn’t what I expected from Apple. I’m not thrilled with the fit and comfort. I, honestly, have to CoNsTaNtLy mess with the fit so I can EVeN HeAr TheM. I find that to be pretty unacceptable. If they are pushed in to far, I can’t hear them at all. I need to position them just right (up, down, depth, and turned in my ear at the correct angle) so I can hear them. If I’m talking, chewing, or otherwise moving…forget about it, they’re as useless as my nipples. It’s stupid to have to keep messing with them so I can hear them. “Ain’t Nobody Got Time For That!” I’m kinda wishing I would have bought the Amazon Echo earbuds. Alexa is vastly superior to Siri and I’m hoping that the use ability and fit will be better."

I don’t know what took me so long to get a pair of AirPods. It’s so nice to not worry about chords getting tangled up and broken. My only complaint is that they do get a bit uncomfortable after a few hours of wearing them (I do have pretty small ears though). The silicone tips on the pros probably would be much more comfortable but I didn’t feel like spending the extra money.

I’m going to give this a 5 because I was able to get apple care for the product which put the fake theory to rest… And that was purchased through Apple directly 🙄 but I was pissed that I had to get the right one replaced because it wouldn’t connect. It’s was replaced through apple… so that also confirmed it not fake ❤️

Just don’t forget putting them back in your case when you're doneCase is prone to getting dirty by design but no biggieI’m an apple hater and I I approve these headphones.Def buying these again if I need to."
"I've had my AirPods for over a year now, and I have to say, I'm still impressed with their quality and performance. I've used them for everything from phone calls and video chats to working out and listening to music, and they've never let me down.Pros:Effortless setup: Connecting the AirPods to my iPhone was a breeze. All I had to do was open the case near my phone and it automatically prompted me to connect.Great sound quality: The sound is crisp and clear, and I never have any trouble hearing my calls or music.Good battery life: I can wear them all day without needing to charge them.Good charging case: The case is small and easy to carry around, and it charges the AirPods quickly.Cons:Price: At this price the AirPods are not cheap, but I think they're worth the investment for their quality and convenience. I also have a set of cheap wireless headphones that work great, so only spend the money if you have it.I also bought a cute pink case for my AirPods and it's perfect. It keeps my AirPods safe and secure, and it makes it easy to spot them in my bag.Overall, I'm very happy with my AirPods and I would definitely recommend them to anyone looking for a high-quality, convenient pair of wireless earbuds."
"Taking the Apple AirPods at face value, they're a solid headset for the money! If you already have the original, first generation AirPods and just want to upgrade, not a bad option either. The 2nd generation AirPods feature an improved software chip & runs off of BlueTooth 5.0 vs 4.1 (Gen 1). The software chip allows a faster, stronger, and more stable connection with your device(s). This particular item for $139.00 does NOT feature the wireless charging case. This one must be plugged in via USB (cable provided in the box) to an outlet or USB port. The wireless charging case model is $169. Now if you're looking to upgrade to the wireless charging case later on, you can. Apple does sell it separately. If you want the wireless charging option right out of the box, I recommend sending the $169 vs the $139 product here.Sound quality: Straight out of the box, sound is pretty solid. No crackles, static, pops, or any abnormal noises created by the more economic-friendly headsets. You have a lot more adjustability & tuning capabilities if paired on an iOS/Apple device vs using for example paired with an Android OS device. So, ultimately Apple users may or may not get a better sound quality experience.Noise cancellation: AirPods do fit fairly well in the ear without having to be jammed inside your ear canal. Generally they create a snug fit using Apple's ""universal"" earphone design, it is one size fits most not one size fits all. Some users have upgraded or opted to spend the additional funds on a set of AirPods Pro due to the rubber tips for a better/snug fit. I believe only the AirPods Pro currently has an active noise cancellation utilizing two microphones but I would double-check Apple for accurate information. Also, for Android users. The Galaxy buds by Samsung feature active noise cancellation & wireless charging case on every model so you might want to look into that product before making a final purchase.Battery life: For optimal battery life, I highly recommend charging both AirPods inside the case. The case itself is a battery pack with a life. So if one or both AirPods are low on battery, you can toss them in the case and charge them up. Apple I believe rates 5 minutes of charging time is equivalent to 1 hour of talk/listening time and 15 minutes of charging time is equivalent to 2 hours of talk/listening. I'm sure this is accurate when they're brand new but I'm sure like anything, normal ware & tare might diminish that over time.Warranty: Apple provides a 1-year standard manufacturer's warranty on this product. This ONLY covers defects/defaults from the manufacturer. This will NOT cover physical and/or liquid damages to AirPods, case, or charging cable included.AppleCare: It's $29.00 and 2 years and well worth the extra money. You're already spending this kind of money on a headset, may as well have protection. We get it, accidents happen! But protect yourself and get your AirPods repaired/replaced at no additional cost to YOU! There is no additional fees or deductibles involved.AppleCare tips:You don't have to install AppleCare right away. You have 60 days from the original purchase date to contact Apple by providing your AirPods serial number (on outside of the box) and Apple will tell you if you're still eligible.You can renew AppleCare for another 2 years for the same fee of $29.00 provided you want to keep the same product. If you decide to upgrade to the AirPods Pro or whatever the latest model is, you would have to purchase AppleCare for that specific product.You can go into an Apple store location and get live repair/replacement on your AirPods.Using AirPods with Android:Apple has allowed Android and other non-iOS devices to use AirPods since the AirPods pair/connect via BlueTooth.If you're using AirPods on an Android platform such as Samsung or LG for example there's 2 ways to pair the headset to your device. You either turn on BlueTooth on your device, pop both AirPods inside your ear, find ""AirPods"" under available connections, and connect. Or you might have to pair manually using the button on the AirPods case to make available, pair, and connect.FAIR WARNING:You will NOT have access to all features that the AirPods have to offer on an Apple/iOS device. You will be limited on functions you can perform.I was able to find an app on Google play store for $1.99 called ""AirPopUp"". It is a paid application that unlock access to certain/more features of the AirPods similar to what an Apple/iOS device would be granted. Be aware that you will NOT have access nor the ability to have every single feature since you're not on Apple's network. There may be other apps (most likely paid applications) you'd have to find that may unlock more features such as: AirPods battery life percentage, case battery life percentage, programming LEFT & RIGHT AirPods for certain function(s), skipping/pausing/resetting songs, answer/decline/hang up phone calls, find my AirPods, and more.For Samsung users specifically, you might want to look into the Galaxy Buds. They're a little cheaper than AirPods, I believe Amazon has them for $109.99 + $22 3-Year insurance through Assurion that does cover physical/liquid/accidental damage just like AirPods.Galaxy Buds features:Made by SamsungAudio powered by AKGRubber ear bud tipsPair with Samsung device to get the mostWireless charging caseActive noise cancellationComes in multiple colors (black/white/silver/yellow/red & black combo with Star Wars edition Galaxy Note 10+)Includes changing cord and replacement rubber earbud tips.I know if you pair the Galaxy Buds with a Samsung device it will automatically download an application titled ""Galaxy Wearable"". This allows users to check battery life status of the case and each bud, prompts you for software updates, ability to program LEFT & RIGHT earbuds to do certain function(s), answer/decline/hang up phone calls, pause/skip/reset songs.Apple may charge a lot of money for their products on accessories but they never fall short of being a revolutionary, well-designed, reliable product that works as advertised."
"I’ll list a few things I think are Good, and What’s Not So Great.The Good: Ummm…Owning an iPhone and a Apple Watch I already have a few lightning cables lying around.Not So Great: The cost. They are not inexpensive. I think I got the cheapest pair and that comes with a wired charging case and really not that impressive of features or sound quality. I am not that thrilled with the fact that the right one went “out” on me. I had to google a remedy for that issue. I believe it involved cleaning them and re-pairing them with my devices. It just wasn’t what I expected from Apple. I’m not thrilled with the fit and comfort. I, honestly, have to CoNsTaNtLy mess with the fit so I can EVeN HeAr TheM. I find that to be pretty unacceptable. If they are pushed in to far, I can’t hear them at all. I need to position them just right (up, down, depth, and turned in my ear at the correct angle) so I can hear them. If I’m talking, chewing, or otherwise moving…forget about it, they’re as useless as my nipples. It’s stupid to have to keep messing with them so I can hear them. “Ain’t Nobody Got Time For That!” I’m kinda wishing I would have bought the Amazon Echo earbuds. Alexa is vastly superior to Siri and I’m hoping that the use ability and fit will be better."
I don’t know what took me so long to get a pair of AirPods. It’s so nice to not worry about chords getting tangled up and broken. My only complaint is that they do get a bit uncomfortable after a few hours of wearing them (I do have pretty small ears though). The silicone tips on the pros probably would be much more comfortable but I didn’t feel like spending the extra money.
I’m going to give this a 5 because I was able to get apple care for the product which put the fake theory to rest… And that was purchased through Apple directly 🙄 but I was pissed that I had to get the right one replaced because it wouldn’t connect. It’s was replaced through apple… so that also confirmed it not fake ❤️
One thing about the apple version of these that I love is that they prompt you to set up as soon as you open them meaning no confusing product orientation.  I take them everywhere I go and since I love the apple headphone shape these are great for work and I use them for running as well.
"Had them for 2 years: dropped the case everyday with headphones inside and will continue to do so. It’s very fun throwing the case around it has a good weight to it and feels good in the hands.When the case falls the AirPods eject out and the AirPods are so light that they basically won’t get any fall damage. Good quality audio punchy bass. And amazing microphone very clear with calls.My only gripe was in the first week of use after purchase , I use both iPhone and android and for some reason on the android they were a little annoying with connecting fast but after a week it connected to the android as quickly as it did with the iPhone. You can still pause and play too but you won’t be able to see battery status. No big deal.Battery life and charge up is good. Expect 6 to 8 hours of playtime and charges up in like 5 minutes for 20~30 min play time. I leave these in my car when it’s hot as hell and the battery is still fine surprisingly. I don’t remember if these come with a cable or not but the apple charger cables  are complete trash and will stop working but yea that’s apple for you.

I love my AirPods. I thought about getting the AirPods Pro but I didn’t wanna spend that much more just to have the noise canceling feature. Now I will probably upgrade in a year or two now that they’ve even improved the AirPods Pro even more.Coming from somebody who has an iPad and iPhone and an iMac at home having the AirPods and the ability to Switch between them so effortlessly without having to unpair and repair is so nice.I’ve had a number of Bluetooth headsets over the years from Plantronics to generic to a number of other different companies I don’t even know if I could remember every different manufacture that I’ve had. I always hated that they were bulky they never fit in my ear just right. I just never felt like they were great and it was always complicated they seem to fuss to pair up and especially if they ever unpaired then it was starting all over again. I love that the minute that I got my AirPods I flipped open the case and right away my iPhone registers that they are there and with the top of a Button on my phone and the top of the button on the AirPods in a couple of seconds I am paired up.I also have a very nice charger that I bought right here on Amazon for about $25 and it will charge my Apple Pencil my AirPods my Apple Watch and my iPhone all at the same time which is amazing and so nice that I can just click my AirPods case on there and they charge up in a very short time.First off I’m not a sound engineer or an audio file so I can’t say that they have the absolute best sound quality and I’m sure that they don’t I can’t imagine that if you went out and got some of the beads or some other type of wireless headset that fits over your entire ear with a bigger driver in it that of course it’s going to have better sound quality.But I love that they are tiny small and easy to just throw in the case. The battery life is great if my case is fully charged with the AirPods in and charged I can go to complete times to almost dead with both AirPods being used. If I only use one way talking on the phone I can go even more so in between case charging times is sometimes over a week which is absolutely amazing. The talk time on them is very long as well. I’ve never sat down and figured up exactly whether I get the exact time that Apple says.I love that the minute that I put them in my ear I get a nice little tone to let me know that they’ve connected if I’m listening to music and I take them out it automatically pauses. I love that it will even pause my music if I get an iMessage and it will read my message it will tell me who it’s from if they’re in my contact list if not it will read me the phone number and then read me the message and then asked me if I would like to respond all without touching my phone.I love Apple products even if they are a little more expensive in some areas but I love that for instance with the AirPods home they tie Effortlessly Into my phone my Mac and my iPad.I absolutely hate when I am talking on the phone for more than a couple of minutes to have to hold the phone. Also I run a business and so I have to multitask sometimes someone calls and I need to be able to pick up a remote to navigate to something to check I may need to grab the computer etc. and having the ability to have both hands free to do something like that while still talking and not worrying about the AirPods falling out of my ear is worth more than the money that I paid for them by far and then all the other features that come with it are great.So in the end I think that they are amazing and I’ve had it again a number of different Bluetooth headsets and they never fit right they fall out of my ear or the ones that took over my ears are always so uncomfortable after a short period of time that I never ended up using them I always ended up using my wired earbuds that come with my iPhone.
"Had them for 2 years: dropped the case everyday with headphones inside and will continue to do so. It’s very fun throwing the case around it has a good weight to it and feels good in the hands.When the case falls the AirPods eject out and the AirPods are so light that they basically won’t get any fall damage. Good quality audio punchy bass. And amazing microphone very clear with calls.My only gripe was in the first week of use after purchase , I use both iPhone and android and for some reason on the android they were a little annoying with connecting fast but after a week it connected to the android as quickly as it did with the iPhone. You can still pause and play too but you won’t be able to see battery status. No big deal.Battery life and charge up is good. Expect 6 to 8 hours of playtime and charges up in like 5 minutes for 20~30 min play time. I leave these in my car when it’s hot as hell and the battery is still fine surprisingly. I don’t remember if these come with a cable or not but the apple charger cables  are complete trash and will stop working but yea that’s apple for you.  The headphones look  ugly at first  because it seems too long but you get used to to the look after a week or twoIf you lose the AirPods tho you better hope you have iPhone, not sure if android has an app to locate them but honestly these aren’t easy to lose as they didn’t fall out of my ears and you can exercise with them as well and sweat with them. Just don’t forget putting them back in your case when you're doneCase is prone to getting dirty by design but no biggieI’m an apple hater and I I approve these headphones.Def buying these again if I need to."
"I've had my AirPods for over a year now, and I have to say, I'm still impressed with their quality and performance. I've used them for everything from phone calls and video chats to working out and listening to music, and they've never let me down.Pros:Effortless setup: Connecting the AirPods to my iPhone was a breeze. All I had to do was open the case near my phone and it automatically prompted me to connect.Great sound quality: The sound is crisp and clear, and I never have any trouble hearing my calls or music.Good battery life: I can wear them all day without needing to charge them.Good charging case: The case is small and easy to carry around, and it charges the AirPods quickly.Cons:Price: At this price the AirPods are not cheap, but I think they're worth the investment for their quality and convenience. I also have a set of cheap wireless headphones that work great, so only spend the money if you have it.I also bought a cute pink case for my AirPods and it's perfect. It keeps my AirPods safe and secure, and it makes it easy to spot them in my bag.Overall, I'm very happy with my AirPods and I would definitely recommend them to anyone looking for a high-quality, convenient pair of wireless earbuds."
"Taking the Apple AirPods at face value, they're a solid headset for the money! If you already have the original, first generation AirPods and just want to upgrade, not a bad option either. The 2nd generation AirPods feature an improved software chip & runs off of BlueTooth 5.0 vs 4.1 (Gen 1). The software chip allows a faster, stronger, and more stable connection with your device(s). This particular item for $139.00 does NOT feature the wireless charging case. This one must be plugged in via USB (cable provided in the box) to an outlet or USB port. The wireless charging case model is $169. Now if you're looking to upgrade to the wireless charging case later on, you can. Apple does sell it separately. If you want the wireless charging option right out of the box, I recommend sending the $169 vs the $139 product here.Sound quality: Straight out of the box, sound is pretty solid. No crackles, static, pops, or any abnormal noises created by the more economic-friendly headsets. You have a lot more adjustability & tuning capabilities if paired on an iOS/Apple device vs using for example paired with an Android OS device. So, ultimately Apple users may or may not get a better sound quality experience.Noise cancellation: AirPods do fit fairly well in the ear without having to be jammed inside your ear canal. Generally they create a snug fit using Apple's ""universal"" earphone design, it is one size fits most not one size fits all. Some users have upgraded or opted to spend the additional funds on a set of AirPods Pro due to the rubber tips for a better/snug fit. I believe only the AirPods Pro currently has an active noise cancellation utilizing two microphones but I would double-check Apple for accurate information. Also, for Android users. The Galaxy buds by Samsung feature active noise cancellation & wireless charging case on every model so you might want to look into that product before making a final purchase.Battery life: For optimal battery life, I highly recommend charging both AirPods inside the case. The case itself is a battery pack with a life. So if one or both AirPods are low on battery, you can toss them in the case and charge them up. Apple I believe rates 5 minutes of charging time is equivalent to 1 hour of talk/listening time and 15 minutes of charging time is equivalent to 2 hours of talk/listening. I'm sure this is accurate when they're brand new but I'm sure like anything, normal ware & tare might diminish that over time.Warranty: Apple provides a 1-year standard manufacturer's warranty on this product. This ONLY covers defects/defaults from the manufacturer. This will NOT cover physical and/or liquid damages to AirPods, case, or charging cable included.AppleCare: It's $29.00 and 2 years and well worth the extra money. You're already spending this kind of money on a headset, may as well have protection. We get it, accidents happen! But protect yourself and get your AirPods repaired/replaced at no additional cost to YOU! There is no additional fees or deductibles involved.AppleCare tips:You don't have to install AppleCare right away. You have 60 days from the original purchase date to contact Apple by providing your AirPods serial number (on outside of the box) and Apple will tell you if you're still eligible.You can renew AppleCare for another 2 years for the same fee of $29.00 provided you want to keep the same product. If you decide to upgrade to the AirPods Pro or whatever the latest model is, you would have to purchase AppleCare for that specific product.You can go into an Apple store location and get live repair/replacement on your AirPods.Using AirPods with Android:Apple has allowed Android and other non-iOS devices to use AirPods since the AirPods pair/connect via BlueTooth.If you're using AirPods on an Android platform such as Samsung or LG for example there's 2 ways to pair the headset to your device. You either turn on BlueTooth on your device, pop both AirPods inside your ear, find ""AirPods"" under available connections, and connect. Or you might have to pair manually using the button on the AirPods case to make available, pair, and connect.FAIR WARNING:You will NOT have access to all features that the AirPods have to offer on an Apple/iOS device. You will be limited on functions you can perform.I was able to find an app on Google play store for $1.99 called ""AirPopUp"". It is a paid application that unlock access to certain/more features of the AirPods similar to what an Apple/iOS device would be granted. Be aware that you will NOT have access nor the ability to have every single feature since you're not on Apple's network. There may be other apps (most likely paid applications) you'd have to find that may unlock more features such as: AirPods battery life percentage, case battery life percentage, programming LEFT & RIGHT AirPods for certain function(s), skipping/pausing/resetting songs, answer/decline/hang up phone calls, find my AirPods, and more.For Samsung users specifically, you might want to look into the Galaxy Buds. They're a little cheaper than AirPods, I believe Amazon has them for $109.99 + $22 3-Year insurance through Assurion that does cover physical/liquid/accidental damage just like AirPods.Galaxy Buds features:Made by SamsungAudio powered by AKGRubber ear bud tipsPair with Samsung device to get the mostWireless charging caseActive noise cancellationComes in multiple colors (black/white/silver/yellow/red & black combo with Star Wars edition Galaxy Note 10+)Includes changing cord and replacement rubber earbud tips.I know if you pair the Galaxy Buds with a Samsung device it will automatically download an application titled ""Galaxy Wearable"". This allows users to check battery life status of the case and each bud, prompts you for software updates, ability to program LEFT & RIGHT earbuds to do certain function(s), answer/decline/hang up phone calls, pause/skip/reset songs.Apple may charge a lot of money for their products on accessories but they never fall short of being a revolutionary, well-designed, reliable product that works as advertised."
"I’ll list a few things I think are Good, and What’s Not So Great.The Good: Ummm…Owning an iPhone and a Apple Watch I already have a few lightning cables lying around.Not So Great: The cost. They are not inexpensive. I think I got the cheapest pair and that comes with a wired charging case and really not that impressive of features or sound quality. I am not that thrilled with the fact that the right one went “out” on me. I had to google a remedy for that issue. I believe it involved cleaning them and re-pairing them with my devices. It just wasn’t what I expected from Apple. I’m not thrilled with the fit and comfort. I, honestly, have to CoNsTaNtLy mess with the fit so I can EVeN HeAr TheM. I find that to be pretty unacceptable. If they are pushed in to far, I can’t hear them at all. I need to position them just right (up, down, depth, and turned in my ear at the correct angle) so I can hear them. If I’m talking, chewing, or otherwise moving…forget about it, they’re as useless as my nipples. It’s stupid to have to keep messing with them so I can hear them. “Ain’t Nobody Got Time For That!” I’m kinda wishing I would have bought the Amazon Echo earbuds. Alexa is vastly superior to Siri and I’m hoping that the use ability and fit will be better."
I don’t know what took me so long to get a pair of AirPods. It’s so nice to not worry about chords getting tangled up and broken. My only complaint is that they do get a bit uncomfortable after a few hours of wearing them (I do have pretty small ears though). The silicone tips on the pros probably would be much more comfortable but I didn’t feel like spending the extra money.
I’m going to give this a 5 because I was able to get apple care for the product which put the fake theory to rest… And that was purchased through Apple directly 🙄 but I was pissed that I had to get the right one replaced because it wouldn’t connect. It’s was replaced through apple… so that also confirmed it not fake ❤️
One thing about the apple version of these that I love is that they prompt you to set up as soon as you open them meaning no confusing product orientation.  I take them everywhere I go and since I love the apple headphone shape these are great for work and I use them for running as well.
"I love the overall look and feel of this product. The sound quality and audio quality both perform very well. They connect very easily across apple devices and doesn't take much to start using them. I thought the product might have been a fake or not real, but I assure you it is. The battery life is just awesome. I can use these anytime of day and travel with them. The product just has a premium feel to them. I love it!"
I love my AirPods. I thought about getting the AirPods Pro but I didn’t wanna spend that much more just to have the noise canceling feature. Now I will probably upgrade in a year or two now that they’ve even improved the AirPods Pro even more.Coming from somebody who has an iPad and iPhone and an iMac at home having the AirPods and the ability to Switch between them so effortlessly without having to unpair and repair is so nice.I’ve had a number of Bluetooth headsets over the years from Plantronics to generic to a number of other different companies I don’t even know if I could remember every different manufacture that I’ve had. I always hated that they were bulky they never fit in my ear just right. I just never felt like they were great and it was always complicated they seem to fuss to pair up and especially if they ever unpaired then it was starting all over again. I love that the minute that I got my AirPods I flipped open the case and right away my iPhone registers that they are there and with the top of a Button on my phone and the top of the button on the AirPods in a couple of seconds I am paired up.I also have a very nice charger that I bought right here on Amazon for about $25 and it will charge my Apple Pencil my AirPods my Apple Watch and my iPhone all at the same time which is amazing and so nice that I can just click my AirPods case on there and they charge up in a very short time.First off I’m not a sound engineer or an audio file so I can’t say that they have the absolute best sound quality and I’m sure that they don’t I can’t imagine that if you went out and got some of the beads or some other type of wireless headset that fits over your entire ear with a bigger driver in it that of course it’s going to have better sound quality.But I love that they are tiny small and easy to just throw in the case.

Read alot of reviews saying fake so wanted to confirm mine are real. Last pair I had for maybe two years? One ear Bud lost its sound quality. Eventually lost the ear buds. Happy to have a new set

It keeps my AirPods safe and secure, and it makes it easy to spot them in my bag.Overall, I'm very happy with my AirPods and I would definitely recommend them to anyone looking for a high-quality, convenient pair of wireless earbuds."
"Taking the Apple AirPods at face value, they're a solid headset for the money! If you already have the original, first generation AirPods and just want to upgrade, not a bad option either. The 2nd generation AirPods feature an improved software chip & runs off of BlueTooth 5.0 vs 4.1 (Gen 1). The software chip allows a faster, stronger, and more stable connection with your device(s). This particular item for $139.00 does NOT feature the wireless charging case. This one must be plugged in via USB (cable provided in the box) to an outlet or USB port. The wireless charging case model is $169. Now if you're looking to upgrade to the wireless charging case later on, you can. Apple does sell it separately. If you want the wireless charging option right out of the box, I recommend sending the $169 vs the $139 product here.Sound quality: Straight out of the box, sound is pretty solid. No crackles, static, pops, or any abnormal noises created by the more economic-friendly headsets. You have a lot more adjustability & tuning capabilities if paired on an iOS/Apple device vs using for example paired with an Android OS device. So, ultimately Apple users may or may not get a better sound quality experience.Noise cancellation: AirPods do fit fairly well in the ear without having to be jammed inside your ear canal. Generally they create a snug fit using Apple's ""universal"" earphone design, it is one size fits most not one size fits all. Some users have upgraded or opted to spend the additional funds on a set of AirPods Pro due to the rubber tips for a better/snug fit. I believe only the AirPods Pro currently has an active noise cancellation utilizing two microphones but I would double-check Apple for accurate information. Also, for Android users. The Galaxy buds by Samsung feature active noise cancellation & wireless charging case on every model so you might want to look into that product before making a final purchase.Battery life: For optimal battery life, I highly recommend charging both AirPods inside the case. The case itself is a battery pack with a life. So if one or both AirPods are low on battery, you can toss them in the case and charge them up. Apple I believe rates 5 minutes of charging time is equivalent to 1 hour of talk/listening time and 15 minutes of charging time is equivalent to 2 hours of talk/listening. I'm sure this is accurate when they're brand new but I'm sure like anything, normal ware & tare might diminish that over time.Warranty: Apple provides a 1-year standard manufacturer's warranty on this product. This ONLY covers defects/defaults from the manufacturer. This will NOT cover physical and/or liquid damages to AirPods, case, or charging cable included.AppleCare: It's $29.00 and 2 years and well worth the extra money. You're already spending this kind of money on a headset, may as well have protection. We get it, accidents happen! But protect yourself and get your AirPods repaired/replaced at no additional cost to YOU! There is no additional fees or deductibles involved.AppleCare tips:You don't have to install AppleCare right away. You have 60 days from the original purchase date to contact Apple by providing your AirPods serial number (on outside of the box) and Apple will tell you if you're still eligible.You can renew AppleCare for another 2 years for the same fee of $29.00 provided you want to keep the same product. If you decide to upgrade to the AirPods Pro or whatever the latest model is, you would have to purchase AppleCare for that specific product.You can go into an Apple store location and get live repair/replacement on your AirPods.Using AirPods with Android:Apple has allowed Android and other non-iOS devices to use AirPods since the AirPods pair/connect via BlueTooth.If you're using AirPods on an Android platform such as Samsung or LG for example there's 2 ways to pair the headset to your device. You either turn on BlueTooth on your device, pop both AirPods inside your ear, find ""AirPods"" under available connections, and connect. Or you might have to pair manually using the button on the AirPods case to make available, pair, and connect.FAIR WARNING:You will NOT have access to all features that the AirPods have to offer on an Apple/iOS device. You will be limited on functions you can perform.I was able to find an app on Google play store for $1.99 called ""AirPopUp"". It is a paid application that unlock access to certain/more features of the AirPods similar to what an Apple/iOS device would be granted. Be aware that you will NOT have access nor the ability to have every single feature since you're not on Apple's network. There may be other apps (most likely paid applications) you'd have to find that may unlock more features such as: AirPods battery life percentage, case battery life percentage, programming LEFT & RIGHT AirPods for certain function(s), skipping/pausing/resetting songs, answer/decline/hang up phone calls, find my AirPods, and more.For Samsung users specifically, you might want to look into the Galaxy Buds. They're a little cheaper than AirPods, I believe Amazon has them for $109.99 + $22 3-Year insurance through Assurion that does cover physical/liquid/accidental damage just like AirPods.Galaxy Buds features:Made by SamsungAudio powered by AKGRubber ear bud tipsPair with Samsung device to get the mostWireless charging caseActive noise cancellationComes in multiple colors (black/white/silver/yellow/red & black combo with Star Wars edition Galaxy Note 10+)Includes changing cord and replacement rubber earbud tips.I know if you pair the Galaxy Buds with a Samsung device it will automatically download an application titled ""Galaxy Wearable"". This allows users to check battery life status of the case and each bud, prompts you for software updates, ability to program LEFT & RIGHT earbuds to do certain function(s), answer/decline/hang up phone calls, pause/skip/reset songs.Apple may charge a lot of money for their products on accessories but they never fall short of being a revolutionary, well-designed, reliable product that works as advertised."
"I’ll list a few things I think are Good, and What’s Not So Great.The Good: Ummm…Owning an iPhone and a Apple Watch I already have a few lightning cables lying around.Not So Great: The cost. They are not inexpensive. I think I got the cheapest pair and that comes with a wired charging case and really not that impressive of features or sound quality. I am not that thrilled with the fact that the right one went “out” on me. I had to google a remedy for that issue. I believe it involved cleaning them and re-pairing them with my devices. It just wasn’t what I expected from Apple. I’m not thrilled with the fit and comfort. I, honestly, have to CoNsTaNtLy mess with the fit so I can EVeN HeAr TheM. I find that to be pretty unacceptable. If they are pushed in to far, I can’t hear them at all. I need to position them just right (up, down, depth, and turned in my ear at the correct angle) so I can hear them. If I’m talking, chewing, or otherwise moving…forget about it, they’re as useless as my nipples. It’s stupid to have to keep messing with them so I can hear them. “Ain’t Nobody Got Time For That!” I’m kinda wishing I would have bought the Amazon Echo earbuds. Alexa is vastly superior to Siri and I’m hoping that the use ability and fit will be better."
"Had them for 2 years: dropped the case everyday with headphones inside and will continue to do so. It’s very fun throwing the case around it has a good weight to it and feels good in the hands.When the case falls the AirPods eject out and the AirPods are so light that they basically won’t get any fall damage. Good quality audio punchy bass. And amazing microphone very clear with calls.My only gripe was in the first week of use after purchase , I use both iPhone and android and for some reason on the android they were a little annoying with connecting fast but after a week it connected to the android as quickly as it did with the iPhone. You can still pause and play too but you won’t be able to see battery status. No big deal.Battery life and charge up is good. Expect 6 to 8 hours of playtime and charges up in like 5 minutes for 20~30 min play time. I leave these in my car when it’s hot as hell and the battery is still fine surprisingly. I don’t remember if these come with a cable or not but the apple charger cables  are complete trash and will stop working but yea that’s apple for you.  The headphones look  ugly at first  because it seems too long but you get used to to the look after a week or twoIf you lose the AirPods tho you better hope you have iPhone, not sure if android has an app to locate them but honestly these aren’t easy to lose as they didn’t fall out of my ears and you can exercise with them as well and sweat with them. Just don’t forget putting them back in your case when you're doneCase is prone to getting dirty by design but no biggieI’m an apple hater and I I approve these headphones.Def buying these again if I need to."

I don’t know what took me so long to get a pair of AirPods. It’s so nice to not worry about chords getting tangled up and broken. My only complaint is that they do get a bit uncomfortable after a few hours of wearing them (I do have pretty small ears though). The silicone tips on the pros probably would be much more comfortable but I didn’t feel like spending the extra money.

I’m going to give this a 5 because I was able to get apple care for the product which put the fake theory to rest… And that was purchased through Apple directly 🙄 but I was pissed that I had to get the right one replaced because it wouldn’t connect. It’s was replaced through apple… so that also confirmed it not fake ❤️

Apple I believe rates 5 minutes of charging time is equivalent to 1 hour of talk/listening time and 15 minutes of charging time is equivalent to 2 hours of talk/listening. I'm sure this is accurate when they're brand new but I'm sure like anything, normal ware & tare might diminish that over time.Warranty: Apple provides a 1-year standard manufacturer's warranty on this product. This ONLY covers defects/defaults from the manufacturer. This will NOT cover physical and/or liquid damages to AirPods, case, or charging cable included.AppleCare: It's $29.00 and 2 years and well worth the extra money. You're already spending this kind of money on a headset, may as well have protection. We get it, accidents happen! But protect yourself and get your AirPods repaired/replaced at no additional cost to YOU! There is no additional fees or deductibles involved.AppleCare tips:You don't have to install AppleCare right away. You have 60 days from the original purchase date to contact Apple by providing your AirPods serial number (on outside of the box) and Apple will tell you if you're still eligible.You can renew AppleCare for another 2 years for the same fee of $29.00 provided you want to keep the same product. If you decide to upgrade to the AirPods Pro or whatever the latest model is, you would have to purchase AppleCare for that specific product.You can go into an Apple store location and get live repair/replacement on your AirPods.Using AirPods with Android:Apple has allowed Android and other non-iOS devices to use AirPods since the AirPods pair/connect via BlueTooth.If you're using AirPods on an Android platform such as Samsung or LG for example there's 2 ways to pair the headset to your device. You either turn on BlueTooth on your device, pop both AirPods inside your ear, find ""AirPods"" under available connections, and connect. Or you might have to pair manually using the button on the AirPods case to make available, pair, and connect.FAIR WARNING:You will NOT have access to all features that the AirPods have to offer on an Apple/iOS device. You will be limited on functions you can perform.I was able to find an app on Google play store for $1.99 called ""AirPopUp"". It is a paid application that unlock access to certain/more features of the AirPods similar to what an Apple/iOS device would be granted. Be aware that you will NOT have access nor the ability to have every single feature since you're not on Apple's network. There may be other apps (most likely paid applications) you'd have to find that may unlock more features such as: AirPods battery life percentage, case battery life percentage, programming LEFT & RIGHT AirPods for certain function(s), skipping/pausing/resetting songs, answer/decline/hang up phone calls, find my AirPods, and more.For Samsung users specifically, you might want to look into the Galaxy Buds. They're a little cheaper than AirPods, I believe Amazon has them for $109.99 + $22 3-Year insurance through Assurion that does cover physical/liquid/accidental damage just like AirPods.Galaxy Buds features:Made by SamsungAudio powered by AKGRubber ear bud tipsPair with Samsung device to get the mostWireless charging caseActive noise cancellationComes in multiple colors (black/white/silver/yellow/red & black combo with Star Wars edition Galaxy Note 10+)Includes changing cord and replacement rubber earbud tips.I know if you pair the Galaxy Buds with a Samsung device it will automatically download an application titled ""Galaxy Wearable"". This allows users to check battery life status of the case and each bud, prompts you for software updates, ability to program LEFT & RIGHT earbuds to do certain function(s), answer/decline/hang up phone calls, pause/skip/reset songs.Apple may charge a lot of money for their products on accessories but they never fall short of being a revolutionary, well-designed, reliable product that works as advertised."
"I’ll list a few things I think are Good, and What’s Not So Great.The Good: Ummm…Owning an iPhone and a Apple Watch I already have a few lightning cables lying around.Not So Great: The cost. They are not inexpensive. I think I got the cheapest pair and that comes with a wired charging case and really not that impressive of features or sound quality. I am not that thrilled with the fact that the right one went “out” on me. I had to google a remedy for that issue. I believe it involved cleaning them and re-pairing them with my devices. It just wasn’t what I expected from Apple. I’m not thrilled with the fit and comfort. I, honestly, have to CoNsTaNtLy mess with the fit so I can EVeN HeAr TheM. I find that to be pretty unacceptable. If they are pushed in to far, I can’t hear them at all. I need to position them just right (up, down, depth, and turned in my ear at the correct angle) so I can hear them. If I’m talking, chewing, or otherwise moving…forget about it, they’re as useless as my nipples. It’s stupid to have to keep messing with them so I can hear them. “Ain’t Nobody Got Time For That!” I’m kinda wishing I would have bought the Amazon Echo earbuds. Alexa is vastly superior to Siri and I’m hoping that the use ability and fit will be better."
I don’t know what took me so long to get a pair of AirPods. It’s so nice to not worry about chords getting tangled up and broken. My only complaint is that they do get a bit uncomfortable after a few hours of wearing them (I do have pretty small ears though). The silicone tips on the pros probably would be much more comfortable but I didn’t feel like spending the extra money.
I’m going to give this a 5 because I was able to get apple care for the product which put the fake theory to rest… And that was purchased through Apple directly 🙄 but I was pissed that I had to get the right one replaced because it wouldn’t connect. It’s was replaced through apple… so that also confirmed it not fake ❤️
One thing about the apple version of these that I love is that they prompt you to set up as soon as you open them meaning no confusing product orientation.  I take them everywhere I go and since I love the apple headphone shape these are great for work and I use them for running as well.
"Had them for 2 years: dropped the case everyday with headphones inside and will continue to do so. It’s very fun throwing the case around it has a good weight to it and feels good in the hands.When the case falls the AirPods eject out and the AirPods are so light that they basically won’t get any fall damage. Good quality audio punchy bass. And amazing microphone very clear with calls.My only gripe was in the first week of use after purchase , I use both iPhone and android and for some reason on the android they were a little annoying with connecting fast but after a week it connected to the android as quickly as it did with the iPhone. You can still pause and play too but you won’t be able to see battery status. No big deal.Battery life and charge up is good. Expect 6 to 8 hours of playtime and charges up in like 5 minutes for 20~30 min play time. I leave these in my car when it’s hot as hell and the battery is still fine surprisingly. I don’t remember if these come with a cable or not but the apple charger cables  are complete trash and will stop working but yea that’s apple for you.  The headphones look  ugly at first  because it seems too long but you get used to to the look after a week or twoIf you lose the AirPods tho you better hope you have iPhone, not sure if android has an app to locate them but honestly these aren’t easy to lose as they didn’t fall out of my ears and you can exercise with them as well and sweat with them. Just don’t forget putting them back in your case when you're doneCase is prone to getting dirty by design but no biggieI’m an apple hater and I I approve these headphones.Def buying these again if I need to."
"I've had my AirPods for over a year now, and I have to say, I'm still impressed with their quality and performance. I've used them for everything from phone calls and video chats to working out and listening to music, and they've never let me down.Pros:Effortless setup: Connecting the AirPods to my iPhone was a breeze. All I had to do was open the case near my phone and it automatically prompted me to connect.Great sound quality: The sound is crisp and clear, and I never have any trouble hearing my calls or music.Good battery life: I can wear them all day without needing to charge them.Good charging case: The case is small and easy to carry around, and it charges the AirPods quickly.Cons:Price: At this price the AirPods are not cheap, but I think they're worth the investment for their quality and convenience. I also have a set of cheap wireless headphones that work great, so only spend the money if you have it.I also bought a cute pink case for my AirPods and it's perfect. It keeps my AirPods safe and secure, and it makes it easy to spot them in my bag.Overall, I'm very happy with my AirPods and I would definitely recommend them to anyone looking for a high-quality, convenient pair of wireless earbuds."
"Taking the Apple AirPods at face value, they're a solid headset for the money! If you already have the original, first generation AirPods and just want to upgrade, not a bad option either. The 2nd generation AirPods feature an improved software chip & runs off of BlueTooth 5.0 vs 4.1 (Gen 1). The software chip allows a faster, stronger, and more stable connection with your device(s). This particular item for $139.00 does NOT feature the wireless charging case. This one must be plugged in via USB (cable provided in the box) to an outlet or USB port. The wireless charging case model is $169. Now if you're looking to upgrade to the wireless charging case later on, you can. Apple does sell it separately. If you want the wireless charging option right out of the box, I recommend sending the $169 vs the $139 product here.Sound quality: Straight out of the box, sound is pretty solid. No crackles, static, pops, or any abnormal noises created by the more economic-friendly headsets. You have a lot more adjustability & tuning capabilities if paired on an iOS/Apple device vs using for example paired with an Android OS device. So, ultimately Apple users may or may not get a better sound quality experience.Noise cancellation: AirPods do fit fairly well in the ear without having to be jammed inside your ear canal. Generally they create a snug fit using Apple's ""universal"" earphone design, it is one size fits most not one size fits all. Some users have upgraded or opted to spend the additional funds on a set of AirPods Pro due to the rubber tips for a better/snug fit. I believe only the AirPods Pro currently has an active noise cancellation utilizing two microphones but I would double-check Apple for accurate information. Also, for Android users. The Galaxy buds by Samsung feature active noise cancellation & wireless charging case on every model so you might want to look into that product before making a final purchase.Battery life: For optimal battery life, I highly recommend charging both AirPods inside the case.

I love my AirPods. I thought about getting the AirPods Pro but I didn’t wanna spend that much more just to have the noise canceling feature. Now I will probably upgrade in a year or two now that they’ve even improved the AirPods Pro even more.Coming from somebody who has an iPad and iPhone and an iMac at home having the AirPods and the ability to Switch between them so effortlessly without having to unpair and repair is so nice.I’ve had a number of Bluetooth headsets over the years from Plantronics to generic to a number of other different companies I don’t even know if I could remember every different manufacture that I’ve had. I always hated that they were bulky they never fit in my ear just right. I just never felt like they were great and it was always complicated they seem to fuss to pair up and especially if they ever unpaired then it was starting all over again. I love that the minute that I got my AirPods I flipped open the case and right away my iPhone registers that they are there and with the top of a Button on my phone and the top of the button on the AirPods in a couple of seconds I am paired up.I also have a very nice charger that I bought right here on Amazon for about $25 and it will charge my Apple Pencil my AirPods my Apple Watch and my iPhone all at the same time which is amazing and so nice that I can just click my AirPods case on there and they charge up in a very short time.First off I’m not a sound engineer or an audio file so I can’t say that they have the absolute best sound quality and I’m sure that they don’t I can’t imagine that if you went out and got some of the beads or some other type of wireless headset that fits over your entire ear with a bigger driver in it that of course it’s going to have better sound quality.But I love that they are tiny small and easy to just throw in the case. The battery life is great if my case is fully charged with the AirPods in and charged I can go to complete times to almost dead with both AirPods being used. If I only use one way talking on the phone I can go even more so in between case charging times is sometimes over a week which is absolutely amazing. The talk time on them is very long as well. I’ve never sat down and figured up exactly whether I get the exact time that Apple says.I love that the minute that I put them in my ear I get a nice little tone to let me know that they’ve connected if I’m listening to music and I take them out it automatically pauses. I love that it will even pause my music if I get an iMessage and it will read my message it will tell me who it’s from if they’re in my contact list if not it will read me the phone number and then read me the message and then asked me if I would like to respond all without touching my phone.I love Apple products even if they are a little more expensive in some areas but I love that for instance with the AirPods home they tie Effortlessly Into my phone my Mac and my iPad.I absolutely hate when I am talking on the phone for more than a couple of minutes to have to hold the phone. Also I run a business and so I have to multitask sometimes someone calls and I need to be able to pick up a remote to navigate to something to check I may need to grab the computer etc. and having the ability to have both hands free to do something like that while still talking and not worrying about the AirPods falling out of my ear is worth more than the money that I paid for them by far and then all the other features that come with it are great.So in the end I think that they are amazing and I’ve had it again a number of different Bluetooth headsets and they never fit right they fall out of my ear or the ones that took over my ears are always so uncomfortable after a short period of time that I never ended up using them I always ended up using my wired earbuds that come with my iPhone.

The headphones look  ugly at first  because it seems too long but you get used to to the look after a week or twoIf you lose the AirPods tho you better hope you have iPhone, not sure if android has an app to locate them but honestly these aren’t easy to lose as they didn’t fall out of my ears and you can exercise with them as well and sweat with them. Just don’t forget putting them back in your case when you're doneCase is prone to getting dirty by design but no biggieI’m an apple hater and I I approve these headphones.Def buying these again if I need to."
"I've had my AirPods for over a year now, and I have to say, I'm still impressed with their quality and performance. I've used them for everything from phone calls and video chats to working out and listening to music, and they've never let me down.Pros:Effortless setup: Connecting the AirPods to my iPhone was a breeze. All I had to do was open the case near my phone and it automatically prompted me to connect.Great sound quality: The sound is crisp and clear, and I never have any trouble hearing my calls or music.Good battery life: I can wear them all day without needing to charge them.Good charging case: The case is small and easy to carry around, and it charges the AirPods quickly.Cons:Price: At this price the AirPods are not cheap, but I think they're worth the investment for their quality and convenience. I also have a set of cheap wireless headphones that work great, so only spend the money if you have it.I also bought a cute pink case for my AirPods and it's perfect. It keeps my AirPods safe and secure, and it makes it easy to spot them in my bag.Overall, I'm very happy with my AirPods and I would definitely recommend them to anyone looking for a high-quality, convenient pair of wireless earbuds."
"Taking the Apple AirPods at face value, they're a solid headset for the money! If you already have the original, first generation AirPods and just want to upgrade, not a bad option either. The 2nd generation AirPods feature an improved software chip & runs off of BlueTooth 5.0 vs 4.1 (Gen 1). The software chip allows a faster, stronger, and more stable connection with your device(s). This particular item for $139.00 does NOT feature the wireless charging case. This one must be plugged in via USB (cable provided in the box) to an outlet or USB port. The wireless charging case model is $169. Now if you're looking to upgrade to the wireless charging case later on, you can. Apple does sell it separately. If you want the wireless charging option right out of the box, I recommend sending the $169 vs the $139 product here.Sound quality: Straight out of the box, sound is pretty solid. No crackles, static, pops, or any abnormal noises created by the more economic-friendly headsets. You have a lot more adjustability & tuning capabilities if paired on an iOS/Apple device vs using for example paired with an Android OS device. So, ultimately Apple users may or may not get a better sound quality experience.Noise cancellation: AirPods do fit fairly well in the ear without having to be jammed inside your ear canal. Generally they create a snug fit using Apple's ""universal"" earphone design, it is one size fits most not one size fits all. Some users have upgraded or opted to spend the additional funds on a set of AirPods Pro due to the rubber tips for a better/snug fit. I believe only the AirPods Pro currently has an active noise cancellation utilizing two microphones but I would double-check Apple for accurate information. Also, for Android users. The Galaxy buds by Samsung feature active noise cancellation & wireless charging case on every model so you might want to look into that product before making a final purchase.Battery life: For optimal battery life, I highly recommend charging both AirPods inside the case. The case itself is a battery pack with a life. So if one or both AirPods are low on battery, you can toss them in the case and charge them up. Apple I believe rates 5 minutes of charging time is equivalent to 1 hour of talk/listening time and 15 minutes of charging time is equivalent to 2 hours of talk/listening. I'm sure this is accurate when they're brand new but I'm sure like anything, normal ware & tare might diminish that over time.Warranty: Apple provides a 1-year standard manufacturer's warranty on this product. This ONLY covers defects/defaults from the manufacturer. This will NOT cover physical and/or liquid damages to AirPods, case, or charging cable included.AppleCare: It's $29.00 and 2 years and well worth the extra money. You're already spending this kind of money on a headset, may as well have protection. We get it, accidents happen! But protect yourself and get your AirPods repaired/replaced at no additional cost to YOU! There is no additional fees or deductibles involved.AppleCare tips:You don't have to install AppleCare right away. You have 60 days from the original purchase date to contact Apple by providing your AirPods serial number (on outside of the box) and Apple will tell you if you're still eligible.You can renew AppleCare for another 2 years for the same fee of $29.00 provided you want to keep the same product. If you decide to upgrade to the AirPods Pro or whatever the latest model is, you would have to purchase AppleCare for that specific product.You can go into an Apple store location and get live repair/replacement on your AirPods.Using AirPods with Android:Apple has allowed Android and other non-iOS devices to use AirPods since the AirPods pair/connect via BlueTooth.If you're using AirPods on an Android platform such as Samsung or LG for example there's 2 ways to pair the headset to your device. You either turn on BlueTooth on your device, pop both AirPods inside your ear, find ""AirPods"" under available connections, and connect. Or you might have to pair manually using the button on the AirPods case to make available, pair, and connect.FAIR WARNING:You will NOT have access to all features that the AirPods have to offer on an Apple/iOS device. You will be limited on functions you can perform.I was able to find an app on Google play store for $1.99 called ""AirPopUp"". It is a paid application that unlock access to certain/more features of the AirPods similar to what an Apple/iOS device would be granted. Be aware that you will NOT have access nor the ability to have every single feature since you're not on Apple's network. There may be other apps (most likely paid applications) you'd have to find that may unlock more features such as: AirPods battery life percentage, case battery life percentage, programming LEFT & RIGHT AirPods for certain function(s), skipping/pausing/resetting songs, answer/decline/hang up phone calls, find my AirPods, and more.For Samsung users specifically, you might want to look into the Galaxy Buds. They're a little cheaper than AirPods, I believe Amazon has them for $109.99 + $22 3-Year insurance through Assurion that does cover physical/liquid/accidental damage just like AirPods.Galaxy Buds features:Made by SamsungAudio powered by AKGRubber ear bud tipsPair with Samsung device to get the mostWireless charging caseActive noise cancellationComes in multiple colors (black/white/silver/yellow/red & black combo with Star Wars edition Galaxy Note 10+)Includes changing cord and replacement rubber earbud tips.I know if you pair the Galaxy Buds with a Samsung device it will automatically download an application titled ""Galaxy Wearable"". This allows users to check battery life status of the case and each bud, prompts you for software updates, ability to program LEFT & RIGHT earbuds to do certain function(s), answer/decline/hang up phone calls, pause/skip/reset songs.Apple may charge a lot of money for their products on accessories but they never fall short of being a revolutionary, well-designed, reliable product that works as advertised."
"I’ll list a few things I think are Good, and What’s Not So Great.The Good: Ummm…Owning an iPhone and a Apple Watch I already have a few lightning cables lying around.Not So Great: The cost. They are not inexpensive. I think I got the cheapest pair and that comes with a wired charging case and really not that impressive of features or sound quality. I am not that thrilled with the fact that the right one went “out” on me. I had to google a remedy for that issue. I believe it involved cleaning them and re-pairing them with my devices. It just wasn’t what I expected from Apple. I’m not thrilled with the fit and comfort. I, honestly, have to CoNsTaNtLy mess with the fit so I can EVeN HeAr TheM. I find that to be pretty unacceptable. If they are pushed in to far, I can’t hear them at all. I need to position them just right (up, down, depth, and turned in my ear at the correct angle) so I can hear them. If I’m talking, chewing, or otherwise moving…forget about it, they’re as useless as my nipples. It’s stupid to have to keep messing with them so I can hear them. “Ain’t Nobody Got Time For That!” I’m kinda wishing I would have bought the Amazon Echo earbuds. Alexa is vastly superior to Siri and I’m hoping that the use ability and fit will be better."
I don’t know what took me so long to get a pair of AirPods. It’s so nice to not worry about chords getting tangled up and broken. My only complaint is that they do get a bit uncomfortable after a few hours of wearing them (I do have pretty small ears though). The silicone tips on the pros probably would be much more comfortable but I didn’t feel like spending the extra money.
I’m going to give this a 5 because I was able to get apple care for the product which put the fake theory to rest… And that was purchased through Apple directly 🙄 but I was pissed that I had to get the right one replaced because it wouldn’t connect. It’s was replaced through apple… so that also confirmed it not fake ❤️
One thing about the apple version of these that I love is that they prompt you to set up as soon as you open them meaning no confusing product orientation.  I take them everywhere I go and since I love the apple headphone shape these are great for work and I use them for running as well.
"I love the overall look and feel of this product. The sound quality and audio quality both perform very well. They connect very easily across apple devices and doesn't take much to start using them. I thought the product might have been a fake or not real, but I assure you it is. The battery life is just awesome. I can use these anytime of day and travel with them. The product just has a premium feel to them. I love it!"
I love my AirPods. I thought about getting the AirPods Pro but I didn’t wanna spend that much more just to have the noise canceling feature. Now I will probably upgrade in a year or two now that they’ve even improved the AirPods Pro even more.Coming from somebody who has an iPad and iPhone and an iMac at home having the AirPods and the ability to Switch between them so effortlessly without having to unpair and repair is so nice.I’ve had a number of Bluetooth headsets over the years from Plantronics to generic to a number of other different companies I don’t even know if I could remember every different manufacture that I’ve had. I always hated that they were bulky they never fit in my ear just right. I just never felt like they were great and it was always complicated they seem to fuss to pair up and especially if they ever unpaired then it was starting all over again. I love that the minute that I got my AirPods I flipped open the case and right away my iPhone registers that they are there and with the top of a Button on my phone and the top of the button on the AirPods in a couple of seconds I am paired up.I also have a very nice charger that I bought right here on Amazon for about $25 and it will charge my Apple Pencil my AirPods my Apple Watch and my iPhone all at the same time which is amazing and so nice that I can just click my AirPods case on there and they charge up in a very short time.First off I’m not a sound engineer or an audio file so I can’t say that they have the absolute best sound quality and I’m sure that they don’t I can’t imagine that if you went out and got some of the beads or some other type of wireless headset that fits over your entire ear with a bigger driver in it that of course it’s going to have better sound quality.But I love that they are tiny small and easy to just throw in the case. The battery life is great if my case is fully charged with the AirPods in and charged I can go to complete times to almost dead with both AirPods being used. If I only use one way talking on the phone I can go even more so in between case charging times is sometimes over a week which is absolutely amazing. The talk time on them is very long as well. I’ve never sat down and figured up exactly whether I get the exact time that Apple says.I love that the minute that I put them in my ear I get a nice little tone to let me know that they’ve connected if I’m listening to music and I take them out it automatically pauses. I love that it will even pause my music if I get an iMessage and it will read my message it will tell me who it’s from if they’re in my contact list if not it will read me the phone number and then read me the message and then asked me if I would like to respond all without touching my phone.I love Apple products even if they are a little more expensive in some areas but I love that for instance with the AirPods home they tie Effortlessly Into my phone my Mac and my iPad.I absolutely hate when I am talking on the phone for more than a couple of minutes to have to hold the phone. Also I run a business and so I have to multitask sometimes someone calls and I need to be able to pick up a remote to navigate to something to check I may need to grab the computer etc. and having the ability to have both hands free to do something like that while still talking and not worrying about the AirPods falling out of my ear is worth more than the money that I paid for them by far and then all the other features that come with it are great.So in the end I think that they are amazing and I’ve had it again a number of different Bluetooth headsets and they never fit right they fall out of my ear or the ones that took over my ears are always so uncomfortable after a short period of time that I never ended up using them I always ended up using my wired earbuds that come with my iPhone.
Read alot of reviews saying fake so wanted to confirm mine are real. Last pair I had for maybe two years? One ear Bud lost its sound quality. Eventually lost the ear buds. Happy to have a new set
